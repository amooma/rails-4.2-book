#Preface

Thank you for buying my 3rd Ruby on Rails book. I wrote this book for
autodidacts who learn best by following clean examples. I don't like the idea
of coding one big single application throughout a book but prefer stand-alone
examples. So you can skip a couple of pages or even chapters without losing
context.

Word of warning: English is not my mother tongue. Therefor this book is
sprinkled with orthography and grammar errors. In case this bothers you now is
the perfect time to return the book to your dealer. Copyediting the text would
result in a 15 USD higher price tag and I believe in affordable books. 

Don't let people fool you into believing that Ruby on Rails is easy to learn.
It is not! It is probably the best and most effective framework to develop
webapplications but it is hard to understand in the beginning. The worst
mistake of all is to not learn Ruby before diving into Ruby on Rails. I made
this one myself. To avoid it this book starts with the basics of Ruby
([Chapter 2, Ruby Basics](chapter02-ruby-basics.html)). You will not become a
Ruby guru after reading it but you'll understand the basic ideas and that is
important.

I'm always thankful for feedback by e-mail (stefan.wintermeyer@amooma.de) and
any good rating on Amazon helps to pave the road for a 5.0 version.

Have fun with Ruby on Rails!
