Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This book requires basic knowledge of HTML, plus the reader - you, in
other words - should also have a basic understanding of programming.

A couple of years ago I made the mistake of trying to understand Ruby on
Rails without knowing anything about Ruby. Ruby just looked so simple,
so I didn't give it another thought. But because I did not have a basic
understanding of Ruby, I was not able to understand Rails properly. So I
kept shunting it into a virtual corner and carried on working with PHP
instead. One can only feel the magic of Rails after understanding the
basics of Ruby.

[quote, Yukihiro Matsumoto]
It is easy to program in Ruby, but Ruby is not a simple language.

This chapter is a tightrope walk between oversimplification and a degree
of detail that is unnecessary for a Rails newbie. After all, the
objective is not becoming a Ruby guru, but understanding Ruby on Rails.
I am going to elaborate on the most important points. The rest is then
up to you. If you would like to know more about Ruby, then I recommend
the book "The Ruby Programming Language" by David Flanagan and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto[Yukihiro Matsumoto].

The command `ruby -v` will print the current running Ruby version:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ruby -v**
ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-darwin14]
$
----

NOTE: The beginning of this chapter is going to be a bit boring.
      Bear with me. It's worth it.

[[hello-world]]
Hello World
~~~~~~~~~~~

Ruby is a scripting language. So it is not compiled and then executed,
but read by an interpreter and then processed line by line.

A simple Ruby program `hello-world.rb` consist of the following line:

[source,ruby]
.hello-world.rb
----
puts 'Hello World!'
----

Use your favorite editor to open a new file with the filename
`hello-world.rb` and insert the above line into it. You can then execute
this Ruby program in the command line as follows:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ruby hello-world.rb**
Hello World!
$
----

A program line in a Ruby program does not have to end with a semicolon.
The Ruby interpreter is even so intelligent that is recognizes if a
program line was split over two or more lines for the sake of
readability. I will spare you the corresponding examples and am only
mentioning this so you don't say or think later, "is it okay like this?"

Indenting code is also not necessary. But it does make it much easier to
read for human beings!

[[puts-and-print]]
puts and print
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you go looking for examples on Ruby on the Internet, you will find
two typical ways of printing text on the screen:

* `puts` prints a string, followed by a newline.
* `print` prints a string (without newline). If the string itself contains a
newline, this will be printed as normal.

Example program (an extension of the program `hello-world.rb`):

[source,ruby]
.hello-world.rb
----
puts 'Hello World!'
puts
puts 'zzz'
print 'Hello World!'
print
puts 'zzz'
----

On the screen, you will see this:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ruby hello-world.rb**
Hello World!

zzz
Hello World!zzz
----

[[comments]]
Comments
^^^^^^^^

A comment in a Ruby program starts with a `#`-sign and ends with a
newline. As an example, I can add a comment to the `hello-world.rb`
above:

[source,ruby]
.hello-world.rb
----
# Program for displaying "Hello World!"
# by Stefan Wintermeyer

puts 'Hello World!'
----

A comment can also follow a program line:

[source,ruby]
.hello-world.rb
----
# Program for displaying "Hello World!"
# by Stefan Wintermeyer

puts 'Hello World!'  # output
----

A `#`-sign within strings in inverted commas is not treated as the start
of a comment. Example program:

[source,ruby]
.hello-world.rb
----
# Example program
# by Stefan Wintermeyer

puts 'Hello World!'
puts '############'
puts
puts '1#2#3#4#5#6#'  # Comment on this
----


[[help-via-ri]]
Help via ri
^^^^^^^^^^^

When programming, you do not always have a Ruby handbook available.
Fortunately, the Ruby developers thought of this and provided a built-in
help feature in form of the program `ri` (of course only if you have
installed the documentation which is the default).

This is a typical chicken and egg situation. How can I explain the Ruby
help feature, if we are only just getting started with Ruby? So I am
going to jump ahead a little and show you how you can search for
information on the class String:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ri String**
= String < Object
[...]
$
----

If we are looking for information on a specific method (chicken-egg!),
then we can also use `ri`. Let's take `gsub` as an example. This is a
method for replacing parts of a String (that is useful now and again).

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ri String.size**
= String.size

(from ruby site)
-------------------------
  str.size     -> integer

-------------------------

Returns the character length of str.
----

The program `ri` always prints the output in the pager program defined
by the shell (for example `less`). You can also use the command option
`-T` to output everything directly to STDOUT.

[[irb]]
irb
~~~

irb stands for **I**nteractive **R**u**b**y and is a kind of sandbox where
you can play around with Ruby at your leisure. irb is launched by
entering `irb` on the shell and ends if you enter `exit`.

An example is worth a thousand words:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> puts 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
=> nil
>> exit
$
----

NOTE: I use `IRB.conf[:PROMPT_MODE] = :SIMPLE` in my `.irbrc` config
      file to generate shorter irb output. You can do the same by
      using `irb --simple-prompt`.

In this chapter, we develop many examples within irb. It is so
wonderfully quick and easy.

[[comments-in-irb]]
Comments in irb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Having comments within `irb` would obviously rarely make sense because
code developed in `irb` is more or less code for the bin. But within
this book, we occasionally use comments even in `irb` to make things
clearer. You can copy these comments along with everything else and
insert them into the `irb` without any problems, or you can simply omit
them.

[[ruby-is-object-oriented]]
Ruby is Object-Oriented
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ruby only knows objects. Everything is an object (sounds almost like
Zen). Every object is an instance of a class. You can find out the class
of an object via the method `.class`.

An object in Ruby is encapsulated and can only be reached from the
outside via the methods of the corresponding object. What does this
mean? I cannot change any property of an object directly from the
outside. The corresponding object has to offer a method with which I can
do so.

[NOTE]
====
Please do not panic if you have no idea what a class and an
object is. I won't tell anyone and you can still work with
it just fine without worrying too much. This topic alone could
fill whole volumes. Roughly speaking, an object is a container
for something and a method changes something in that container.

Please go on reading and have a look at the examples. The puzzle
will gradually get clearer.
====

[[methods]]
Methods
^^^^^^^

In other programming languages, the terms you would use for Ruby methods
would be: functions, procedures, subroutines and of course methods.


[NOTE]
====
Here we go with the oversimplification. We can not compare non-Object
oriented programming languages with OO ones. Plus there are two kinds of
methods (class methods and instance methods). At this point, I do not
want to make it too complicated and am simply ignoring this "fine"
distinctions for now.
====

At this point you start looking for a good example, but all I can think
of are silly ones. The problem is the assumption that we are only
allowed to use knowledge that has already been described previously in
this book.

So let's assume that we use the following code sequence repeatedly (for
whatever reason):

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **puts 'Hello World!'**
Hello World!
=> nil
>> **puts 'Hello World!'**
Hello World!
=> nil
>> **puts 'Hello World!'**
Hello World!
=> nil
>> **exit**
$
----

So we want to output the string “Hello World!” three times in a row. As
this makes our daily work routine much longer, we are now going to
define a method (with the meaningless name `three\_times`), with which
this can all be done in one go.

IMPORTANT: Names of methods are always written in lower case.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **def three_times**
>>   **puts 'Hello World!'**
>>   **puts 'Hello World!'**
>>   **puts 'Hello World!'**
>> **end**
=> :three_times
>> **three_times**
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>>
----

When defining a method, you can define required parameters and use them
within the method. This enables us to create a method to which we pass a
string as parameter and we can then output it three times.

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **def three_times(value)**
>>   **puts value**
>>   **puts value**
>>   **puts value**
>> **end**
=> :three_times
>> **three_times('Hello World!')**
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>>
----

Incidentally, you can omit the brackets when calling the method.

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **three_times 'Hello World!'**
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>>
----

[TIP]
====
Ruby gurus and would-be gurus are going to turn up their noses on the
subject of “unnecessary” brackets in your programs and will probably
pepper you with more or less stupid comments with comparisons to Java
and other programming languages.

There is one simple rule in the Ruby community: the fewer brackets, the
cooler you are! `;-)`

But you won't get a medal for using fewer brackets. Decide for yourself
what makes you happy.
====

If you do not specify a parameter with the above method, you will get
the error message: `wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **three_times**
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)
    from (irb):1:in `three_times'
    from (irb):6
    from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> exit
$
----

You can give the variable `value` a default value and then you can also
call the method without parameter:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **def three_times(value = 'blue')**
>>   **puts value**
>>   **puts value**
>>   **puts value**
>> **end**
=> :three_times
>> **three_times('Hello World!')**
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>> **three_times**
blue
blue
blue
=> nil
>> exit
----

[[classes]]
Classes
^^^^^^^

For now you can think of a class as a collection of methods. The name of
a class always starts with an upper case letter. Let's assume that the
method belongs to the new class `This_and_that`. It would then be
defined as follows in a Ruby program:

[source,ruby]
----
class This_and_that
  def three_times
    puts 'Hello World!'
    puts 'Hello World!'
    puts 'Hello World!'
  end
end
----

Let's play it through in `irb`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **class This_and_that**
>>   **def three_times**
>>     **puts 'Hello World!'**
>>     **puts 'Hello World!'**
>>     **puts 'Hello World!'**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :three_times
>>
----

Now we try to call the method `three_times`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **This_and_that.three_times**
NoMethodError: undefined method `three_times' for This_and_that:Class
  from (irb):8
  from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>>
----

This results in an error message, because `This_and_that` is a class
and not an instance. As we are working with instance methods, it only
works if we have first created a new object (a new instance) of the
class `This_and_that` with the class method new:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **abc = This_and_that.new**
=> #<This_and_that:0x007fc6f306bd70>
>> **abc.three_times**
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>> **exit**
$
----

I will explain the difference between instance and class methods in more
detail in link:#class-methods-and-instance-methods[the section called
"Class Methods and Instance Methods"]. Another chicken and egg problem.

[[private-methods]]
Private Methods
+++++++++++++++

Quite often it makes sense to only call a method within its own class or
own instance. Such methods are referred to as private methods (as
opposed to public methods), and they are listed below the keyword
`private` within a class.

irb example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **class Example**
>>   **def a**
>>     **puts 'a'**
>>   **end**
>>   **private**
>>   **def b**
>>     **puts 'b'**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :b
>> **abc = Example.new**
=> #<Example:0x007fbb3383b1e8>
>> **abc.a**
a
=> nil
>> **abc.b**
NoMethodError: private method `b' called for #<Example:0x007fbb3383b1e8>
  from (irb):13
  from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> **exit**
$
----

[[method-initialize]]
Method initialize()
+++++++++++++++++++

If a new instance is created (by calling the method new), the method
that is processed first and automatically is the method `initialize`.
The method is automatically a private method, even if it not listed
explicitly under `private`.

irb example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **class Room**
>>   **def initialize**
>>     **puts 'abc'**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :initialize
>> **kitchen = Room.new**
abc
=> #<Room:0x007fba8b050350>
>> **exit**
$
----

The instance `kitchen` is created with `Room.new` and the method
initialize is processed automatically.

The method new accepts the parameters specified for the method
initialize:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **class Example**
>>   **def initialize(value)**
>>     **puts value**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :initialize
>> **abc = Example.new('Hello World!')**
Hello World!
=> #<Example:0x007f8389040088>
>> **exit**
$
----

[[return]]
return
++++++

puts is nice to demonstrate an example in this book but normally you
need a way to return the result of something. The `return` statement can
be used for that:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **def area_of_a_circle(radius)**
>>   **pi = 3.14**
>>   **area = pi * radius * radius**
>>   **return area**
>> **end**
=> :area_of_a_circle
>> **area_of_a_circle(10)**
=> 314.0
>> **exit**
----

But it wouldn't be Ruby if you couldn't do it shorter. You can simply
skip return:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **def area_of_a_circle(radius)**
>>   **pi = 3.14**
>>   **area = pi * radius * radius**
>>   **area**
>> **end**
=> :area_of_a_circle
>> **area_of_a_circle(10)**
=> 314.0
>> **exit**
----

You can actually even skip the last line because Ruby returns the value
of the last expression as a default:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **def area_of_a_circle(radius)**
>>   **pi = 3.14**
>>   **area = pi * radius * radius**
>> **end**
=> :area_of_a_circle
>> **area_of_a_circle(10)**
=> 314.0
>> **exit**
----

`return` is sometimes useful to make a method easier to read. But you
don't have to use it in case you feel more comfortable with out.

[[inheritance]]
Inheritance
+++++++++++

A class can inherit from another class. When defining the class, the
parent class must be added with a `<` (smaller than) sign:

[source,ruby]
----
class Example < ParentClass
----

Rails makes use of this approach very frequently (otherwise I would not
be bothering you with it).

In the following example, we define the class `Abc` and which contains
the methods `a`, `b` and `c`. Then we define a class Abcd and let it
inherit the class `Abc` and add a new method `d`. The new instances
`example1` and `example2` are created with the Class-Methods new and
show that `example2` has access to the methods a, b, c and d but
`example1` only to `a`, `b` and `c`.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **class Abc**
>>   **def a**
>>     **'a'**
>>   **end**
>>   **def b**
>>     **'b'**
>>   **end**
>>   **def c**
>>     **'c'**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :c
>> **class Abcd < Abc**
>>   **def d**
>>     **'d'**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :d
>> **example1 = Abc.new**
=> #<Abc:0x007f827b958a30>
>> **example2 = Abcd.new**
=> #<Abcd:0x007f827b931610>
>> **example2.d**
=> "d"
>> **example2.a**
=> "a"
>> **example1.d**
NoMethodError: undefined method `d' for #<Abc:0x007fc73a0731c8>
    from (irb):19
    from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> **example1.a**
=> "a"
>> **exit**
$
----

[TIP]
====
It is important to read the Error-Messages. They tell you what happend
and where to search for the problem. In this example Ruby said that
there is an `undefined method` for `#<Abc:0x007fb463023928>`. With that
information you know that the Class `Abc` is missing the method which
you were trying to use.
====

[[class-methods-and-instance-methods]]
Class Methods and Instance Methods
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two important kinds of methods: class methods and instance
methods.

You now already know what a class it. And an instance of such a class is
created via the class method `new`. A class method can only be called in
connection with the class (for example, the method `new` is a class
method). An instance method is a method that only works with an
instance. So you cannot apply the method `new` to an instance.

Let's first try to call an instance method as class method:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **class Knowledge**
>>   **def pi**
>>     **3.14**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :pi
>> **Knowlegde.pi**
NameError: uninitialized constant Knowlegde
  from (irb):6
  from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
----

So that does not work. Well, then let's create a new instance of the
class and try again:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **example = Knowledge.new**
=> #<Knowledge:0x007fce04039bf0>
>> **example.pi**
=> 3.14
>> **exit**
$
----

Now we just need to find out how to define a class method. Hardcore
Rails gurus would now whisk you away into the depths of the source code
and pick out examples from the ActiveRecord. I will spare you this and
show an abstract example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **class Knowledge**
>>   **def self.pi**
>>     **3.14**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :pi
>> **Knowledge.pi**
=> 3.14
>>
----

And the proof to the contrary:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **example = Knowledge.new**
=> #<Knowledge:0x007ffda3050980>
>> **example.pi**
NoMethodError: undefined method `pi' for #<Knowledge:0x007ffda3050980>
  from (irb):7
  from /usr/local/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> **exit**
$
----

There are different notations for defining class methods. The two most
common ones are:

* self.xyz
+
----
# Variant 1
# with self.xyz
#
class Knowledge
  def self.pi
    3.14
  end
end
----

* class << self
+
----
# Variant 2
# with class << self
#
class Knowledge
  class << self
    def pi
      3.14
    end
  end
end
----

The result is always the same.

Of course you can use the same method name for a class and an instance
method. Obviously that doesn't make code easier to understand. Here is
an example with `pi` as a class and an instance method:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **class Knowledge**
>>   **def pi**
>>     **3.14**
>>   **end**
>>   **def self.pi**
>>     **3.14159265359**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :pi
>> **Knowledge.pi**
=> 3.14159265359
>> **example = Knowledge.new**
=> #<Knowledge:0x007fa5c28890b8>
>> **example.pi**
=> 3.14
>> **exit**
$
----

[[list-of-all-instance-methods]]
List of All Instance Methods

You can read out all defined methods for a class with the method
`instance_methods`. We try it out with the class `Knowledge` (first we
create it once again in the irb):

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **class Knowledge**
>>   **def pi**
>>     **3.14**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :pi
>> **Knowledge.instance_methods**
=> [:pi, :nil?, :===, :=~, :!~, :eql?, :hash, :<=>, :class,
:singleton_class, :clone, :dup, :itself, :taint, :tainted?,
:untaint, :untrust, :untrusted?, :trust, :freeze, :frozen?,
:to_s, :inspect, :methods, :singleton_methods, :protected_methods,
:private_methods, :public_methods, :instance_variables,
:instance_variable_get, :instance_variable_set,
:instance_variable_defined?, :remove_instance_variable,
:instance_of?, :kind_of?, :is_a?, :tap, :send, :public_send,
:respond_to?, :extend, :display, :method, :public_method,
:singleton_method, :define_singleton_method, :object_id, :to_enum,
:enum_for, :==, :equal?, :!, :!=, :instance_eval, :instance_exec,
:__send__, :__id__]
>>
----

But that is much more than we have defined! Why? It's because Ruby gives
every new class a basic set of methods by default. If we only want to
list the methods that we have defined, then we can do it like this:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **Knowledge.instance_methods(false)**
=> [:pi]
>> **exit**
$
----

[[variables]]
Variables
~~~~~~~~~

You already know that everything in Ruby is an object. So a variable
must also be an object.

[[naming-conventions]]
Naming Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Normal variables are written in lower case. Constants start with an
upper case letter.

WARNING: A constant can also be overwritten with a new value in
         Ruby (but you will get a warning message). So please do
         not rely on the constancy of a constant.

You are on the safe side if you are using only ASCII symbols. But with
Ruby 2.2 and the right encoding, you could also use special characters
(for example German umlauts) more or less without any problems in a
variable name. But if you want to be polite towards other programmers
who probably do not have those characters directly available on their
keyboards, it is better to stick to pure ASCII.

[[strings]]
Strings
^^^^^^^

Let's experiment a little bit in the `irb`. The method `.class` tells us
which class we are dealing with.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = 'First test'**
=> "First test"
>> **a.class**
=> String
----

That was easy. As you can see, Ruby “automagically” creates an object of
the class `String`. We could also do this by explicitly calling the
method `new`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **b = String.new('Second test')**
=> "Second test"
>> **b.class**
=> String
----

If we call `String.new` without a parameter, this also creates an object
of the class `String`. But it is an empty String:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **c = String.new**
=> ""
>> **c.class**
=> String
>> **exit**
$
----

[[single-and-double-quotations-marks]]
Single and Double Quotations Marks
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Strings can be defined either in single quotes or double quotes.

NOTE: If we mention single or double quotation marks in the
      context of strings, we do not mean typographically correct
      curly quotation marks (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark[wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark]), but the ASCII symbols referred to as _apostrophe_ (`'`) or _quotation mark_(`"`).

There is a special feature for the double quotes: you can integrate
expressions with the construct `#{}`. The result is then automatically
inserted in the corresponding place in the string.

Example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = 'blue'**
=> "blue"
>> **b = "Color: #{a}"**
=> "Color: blue"
>> **b.class**
=> String
>> **exit**
$
----

If the result of the expression is not a string, Ruby tries to apply the
method `to_s` in order to convert the value of the object into a string.

[[integers]]
Integers
^^^^^^^^

[[fixnum-and-bignum]]
Fixnum and Bignum
+++++++++++++++++

`Fixnum` and `Bignum` are `Integer` classes. A `Fixnum` is an `Integer`
that can be saved in a `Word`. If a `Fixnum` gets bigger, it
automatically becomes a `Bignum`. Here is an example where a becomes
larger and by that becomes a `Bignum`.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **20.class**
=> Fixnum
>> **a = 20**
=> 20
>> **a.class**
=> Fixnum
>> **a = a * 5555555555**
=> 111111111100
>> **a.class**
=> Fixnum
>> **a = a * 5555555555**
=> 617283950493827160500
>> **a.class**
=> Bignum
>> **exit**
$

[[floats]]
Floats
++++++

`Float` is a class for real numbers (“floating point numbers”). The
decimal separator is a point.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = 20.424**
=> 20.424
>> **a.class**
=> Float
>> **42.2.class**
=> Float
>> **exit**
$
----

[[simple-calculations]]
Simple Calculations
+++++++++++++++++++

Calculating with integers and floats is so easy that you can describe
everything with just a few lines of code in the `irb`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = 10**
=> 10
>> **b = 23**
=> 23
>> **a + b**
=> 33
>> **(a + b).class**
=> Fixnum
>> **c = a + b**
=> 33
>> **c.class**
=> Fixnum
>> **d = 3.14**
=> 3.14
>> **e = a + d**
=> 13.14
>> **e.class**
=> Float
>> **a * b**
=> 230
>> **(a * b).class**
=> Fixnum
>> **(a * b * d).class**
=> Float
>> **exit**
$
----

[[boolean-values-and-nil]]
Boolean Values and nil
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For boolean values (`true` and `false`) and for `nil` (no value) there
are separate classes:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **true.class**
=> TrueClass
>> **false.class**
=> FalseClass
>> **nil.class**
=> NilClass
>> **exit**
$
----

`nil` (no value) is, by the way, the contraction of the Latin word
_nihil_ (nothing) or, if you look at it in terms of programming history,
the term derives from “_not in list_” from the legacy of the programming
language Lisp (the name is an acronym of _List Processing_).

[[scope-of-variables]]
Scope of Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variables have a different scope (or “reach”) within the Ruby
application and therefore also within a Ruby on Rails application.

IMPORTANT: You need to keep this scope in mind while programming.
           Otherwise you can end up with odd effects.

[[local-variables-aaa-or-_aaa]]
Local Variables (`aaa` or `_aaa`)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Local variables either start with a lower case letter or an underscore
(`_`). Their scope is limited to the current environment (for example
the current method). The follwing example defines two methods which use
the same local variable radius. Because they are local they don't
interact with each other:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **def area(radius)**
>> **  3.14 * radius * radius**
>> **end**
=> :area
>> **def circumference(radius)**
>> **  2 * 3.14 * radius**
>> **end**
=> :circumference
>> **area(10)**
=> 314.0
>> **circumference(1)**
=> 6.28
>> **exit**
$
----

[[global-variables-aaa]]
Global Variables (`$aaa`)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

A global variable starts with a `$`-sign and is accessible in the entire
programm. Example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **$value = 10**
=> 10
>> **puts $value**
10
=> nil
>> **def example**
>>   **$value = 20**
>> **end**
=> :example
>> **puts $value**
10
=> nil
>> **example**
=> 20
>> **puts $value**
20
=> nil
>> **exit**
$
----

Global variables are used very rarely!

[[instance-variables-aaa]]
Instance Variables (`@aaa`)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Instance variables (“*A*ttributes”, hence the `@`) only apply within a
class, but everywhere in it – a mini version of global variables, so to
speak. Unlike global variables, you will find instance variables all
over the place in a Rails application. Let's tackle them in form of an
example program with the name `color.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.color.rb
----
class Wall
  def initialize
    @color = 'white'
  end

  def color
    @color
  end

  def paint_it(value)
    @color = value
  end
end

my_wall = Wall.new
puts my_wall.color

my_wall.paint_it('red')
puts my_wall.color
----

If you start this program, the following output will appear:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ruby color.rb**
white
red
$
----

In the method `initialize` we set the instance variable `@color` to the
value “white”. The method `paint_it(value)` changes this instance
variable.

With the method `color` we can access the value of `@color` outside of
the instance. This kind of method is called a setter method.

[[methods-once-again]]
Methods Once Again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to keep the amount of chicken and egg problems in this chapter
at a manageable level, we need to go back to the topic Methods and
combine what we have learned so far.

[[getters-and-setters]]
Getters and Setters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As instance variables Rubyinstance variables (“attributes”) only exist
within the relevant instance, you always need to write a “getter” method
for exporting such a variable. If we define a class `Room` that has the
instance variables `@doors` and `@windows` (for the number of doors and
windows in the room), then we can create the getter methods `doors` und
`windows` (example program `room.rb`):

[source,ruby]
.room.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  def doors
    @doors
  end

  def windows
    @windows
  end
end

kitchen = Room.new

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
----

The execution of the program:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ruby room.rb**
D: 1
W: 1
$
----

As this scenario – wanting to simply return a value in identical form –
is so common, there is already a ready-made getter method for it with
the name `attr_reader`, which you would apply as follows in the program
`room.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.room.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_reader :doors, :windows
end

kitchen = Room.new

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
----

`attr_reader` is a method which is called on the `Room` class. That is
the reason why we use Symbols (e.g. `:doors` and `:windows`) instead of
variables (e.g. `@doors` and `@windows`) as parameter.

NOTE: `attr_reader` is a good example for meta programming in Ruby.
      When working with Rails, you will frequently come across meta
      programming and be grateful for how it works automagically.

If you want to change the number of doors or windows from the outside,
you need a “setter” method. It can be implemented as follows:

[source,ruby]
.room.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_reader :doors, :windows

  def doors=(value)
    @doors = value
  end

  def windows=(value)
    @windows = value
  end
end

kitchen = Room.new

kitchen.windows = 2

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
----

The corresponding output is this:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ruby room.rb**
D: 1
W: 2
$
----

As you can probably imagine, there is of course also a ready-made and
easier way of doing this. Via the setter method `attr_writer` you can
simplify the code of `room.rb` further:

[source,ruby]
.room.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_reader :doors, :windows
  attr_writer :doors, :windows
end

kitchen = Room.new

kitchen.windows = 2

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
----

And (who would have thought!) there is even a method `attr_accessor`
that combines getters and setters. The code for `room.rb` would then
look like this:

[source,ruby]
.room.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_accessor :doors, :windows
end


kitchen = Room.new

kitchen.windows = 2

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
----

[[built-in-methods-for-string]]
Built-In Methods for String
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most classes already come with a bundle of very useful methods. These
methods are always written after the relevant object, separated by a
point.

Here are a few examples for methods of the class `String`.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = 'A dog'**
=> "A dog"
>> **a.class**
=> String
>> **a.size**
=> 5
>> **a.downcase**
=> "a dog"
>> **a.upcase**
=> "A DOG"
>> **a.reverse**
=> "god A"
>> **exit**
$
----

With `instance_methods(false)` you can get a list of the build in
methods:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **String.instance_methods(false)**
=> [:<=>, :==, :===, :eql?, :hash, :casecmp, :+, :*, :%, :[], :[]=, :insert, :length,
:size, :bytesize, :empty?, :=~, :match, :succ, :succ!, :next, :next!, :upto, :index,
:rindex, :replace, :clear, :chr, :getbyte, :setbyte, :byteslice, :scrub, :scrub!,
:freeze, :to_i, :to_f, :to_s, :to_str, :inspect, :dump, :upcase, :downcase,
:capitalize, :swapcase, :upcase!, :downcase!, :capitalize!, :swapcase!, :hex, :oct,
:split, :lines, :bytes, :chars, :codepoints, :reverse, :reverse!, :concat, :<<,
:prepend, :crypt, :intern, :to_sym, :ord, :include?, :start_with?, :end_with?,
:scan, :ljust, :rjust, :center, :sub, :gsub, :chop, :chomp, :strip, :lstrip, :rstrip,
:sub!, :gsub!, :chop!, :chomp!, :strip!, :lstrip!, :rstrip!, :tr, :tr_s, :delete,
:squeeze, :count, :tr!, :tr_s!, :delete!, :squeeze!, :each_line, :each_byte,
:each_char, :each_codepoint, :sum, :slice, :slice!, :partition, :rpartition,
:encoding, :force_encoding, :b, :valid_encoding?, :ascii_only?, :unpack, :encode,
:encode!, :to_r, :to_c, :unicode_normalize, :unicode_normalize!, :unicode_normalized?]
>> **exit**
$
----

If you are not sure what one of these methods does you can use `ri` to
look it up:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ri String.size**
= String.size

(from ruby site)
--------------------------
  str.size     -> integer

--------------------------

Returns the character length of str.
----

[[method-chaining]]
Method Chaining
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may not think of it straight away, but once you have got used to
working with Ruby, then it makes perfect sense (and is perfectly
logical) to chain different methods.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = 'A dog'**
=> "A dog"
>> **a.upcase.reverse**
=> "GOD A"
>> **exit**
$
----

[[converting-from-one-to-the-other-casting]]
Converting from One to the Other: Casting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a whole range of useful instance methods for converting
(“casting”) objects from one class to another. First, let's use the
method `.to_s` to convert a `Fixnum` to a `String`.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = 10**
=> 10
>> **a.class**
=> Fixnum
>> **b = a.to_s**
=> "10"
>> **b.class**
=> String
>> **exit**
$
----

NOTE: Incidentally, that is exactly what `puts` does if you use `puts`
      to output a `Fixnum` or a `Float` (for non-strings, it simply
      implicitly adds the method `.to_s` and outputs the result).

Now we use the method `.to_i` to change a `Float` to a `Fixnum`.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **c = 10.0**
=> 10.0
>> **c.class**
=> Float
>> **d = c.to_i**
=> 10
>> **d.class**
=> Fixnum
>> **exit**
$
----

[[method-to_s-for-your-own-classes]]
Method `to_s` for Your Own Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should always integrate a method `to_s` for your own custom classes,
even if it is just for the sake of easier debugging. Then you can simply
output a corresponding object via `puts` (`puts` automatically outputs
an object via the method `to_s`).

Here is an example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **class Person**
>>   **def initialize(first_name, last_name)**
>>     **@first_name = first_name**
>>     **@last_name = last_name**
>>   **end**
>>   **def to_s**
>>     **"#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :to_s
>> **person1 = Person.new('Stefan', 'Wintermeyer')**
=> #<Person:0x007ffeaa84af98 @first_name="Stefan", @last_name="Wintermeyer">
>> **puts person1**
Stefan Wintermeyer
=> nil
>> **exit**
$
----

[[is-a-method]]
Is `+` a Method?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Why is there also a plus symbol in the list of methods for String? Let's
find out by looking it up in `ri`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ri -T String.+**
String.+

(from ruby site)
--------------------------------
  str + other_str   -> new_str

--------------------------------

Concatenation---Returns a new String containing other_str
concatenated to str.

  "Hello from " + self.to_s   #=> "Hello from main"
----

hmmm ... Let's see what it says for `Fixnum`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ri -T Fixnum.+**
Fixnum.+

(from ruby site)
-----------------------------------
  fix + numeric  ->  numeric_result

-----------------------------------

Performs addition: the class of the resulting object depends on the class of
numeric and on the magnitude of the result.
----

Let's have a go and play around with this in `irb`. So we should be able
to add the `+` to an object, just as any other method, separated by a dot
and add the second number in brackets as parameter:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **10 + 10**
=> 20
>> **10+10**
=> 20
>> **10.+10**
=> 20
>> **10.+(10)**
=> 20
>> **exit**
$
----

Aha! The plus symbol is indeed a method, and this method takes the next
value as parameter. Really we should put this value in brackets, but
thanks to Ruby's well thought-out syntax this is not necessary.

[[can-i-overwrite-the-method]]
Can I Overwrite the Method `+`?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Yes, you can overwrite any method. Logically, this does not make much
sense for methods such as `+`, unless you want to drive your fellow
programmers mad. I am going to show you a little demo in `irb` so you
will believe me.

The aim is overwriting the method `+` for `Fixnum`. We want the result
of every addition to be the number 42.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **10 + 10**
=> 20
>> **class Fixnum**
>>   **def +(name, *args, &blk)**
>>     **42**
>>   **end**
>> **end**
=> :+
>> **10 + 10**
=> 42
>> **exit**
$
----

First we perform a normal addition. Than we redefine the method `+` for
the class `Fixnum`, and after that we do the calculation again. But this
time, with different results.

[[if-condition]]
if-Condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An abstract `if`-condition looks like this:

[source,ruby]
----
if expression
  program
end
----

The program between the expression and `end` is executed if the result
of the expression is not `false` and not `nil`.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use a `then` after the expression:

[source,ruby]
----
if expression then
  program
end
----
====

The construct for a simple `if`-branch in a Ruby program looks like the
following example program:

[source,ruby]
----
a = 10

if a == 10
  puts 'a is 10'
end
----

IMPORTANT: The `==` is used to compare two values.
           Please don't mix it up with the single `=`.

You can try an _expression_ really well in `irb`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = 10**
=> 10
>> **a == 10**
=> true
>> **exit**
$
----

[[shorthand]]
Shorthand
^^^^^^^^^

A frequently used shorthand notation of an `if`-condition can be found
in the following code:

[source,ruby]
----
a = 10

# long version
#
if a == 10
  puts 'a is 10'
end

# short version
#
puts 'a is 10' if a == 10
----

[[else]]
else
^^^^

You can probably imagine how this works, but for the sake of
completeness, here is a little example:

[source,ruby]
----
a = 10

if a == 10
  puts 'a is 10'
else
  puts 'a is not 10'
end
----

[[elsif]]
elsif
^^^^^

Again, most programmers will know what this is all about. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
a = 10

if a == 10
  puts 'a is 10'
elsif a == 20
  puts 'a is 20'
end
----

[[loops]]
Loops
~~~~~

There are different ways of implementing loops in Ruby. The iterator
variation is used particularly often in the Rails environment.

[[while-and-until]]
while and until
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An abstract while loop looks like this:

[source,ruby]
----
while expression do
  program
end
----

[NOTE]
====
The `do` that follows the `expression` is optional. Often you will also
see this:

[source,ruby]
----
while expression
  program
end
----
====

Here is a practical `irb` example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **i = 0**
=> 0
>> **while i < 3 do**
?>   **puts i**
>>   **i = i + 1**
>> **end**
0
1
2
=> nil
>> **exit**
$
----

`Until` loops are built similarly:

[source,ruby]
----
until expression
  program
ends
----

Again, here is the corresponding `irb` example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **i = 5**
=> 5
>> **until i == 0**
>>   **i = i - 1**
>>   **puts i**
>> **end**
4
3
2
1
0
=> nil
>> **exit**
$
----

[[blocks-and-iterators]]
Blocks and Iterators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

“Block” and “iterator” are some of the favorite words of many Ruby
programmers. Now I am going to show you why.

In the loop

[source,ruby]
----
5.times { |i| puts i }
----

`i` is the iterator and `puts i` is the block.

You can also express the whole thing in the following syntax:

[source,ruby]
----
5.times do |i|
  puts i
end
----

[[iterators]]
Iterators
+++++++++

Iterators are just a specific type of method. As you probably know, the
word “_iterate_” means to repeat something. For example, the class
Fixnum has the iterator times() Rubytimes. Let's see what help `ri`
offers us:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ri -T Fixnum.times**
Fixnum.times

(from ruby site)
Implementation from Integer
-------------------------------------------
  int.times {|i| block }  ->  self
  int.times               ->  an_enumerator


-------------------------------------------

Iterates block int times, passing in values from zero to int -
1.

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.

  5.times do |i|
    print i, " "
  end

produces:

  0 1 2 3 4
----

And it also gives a nice example that we are going to try out in irb:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **5.times do |i|**
?>   **puts i**
>> **end**
0
1
2
3
4
=> 5
>> **exit**
$
----

There is also a single-line notation for small blocks:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **5.times { |i| puts i }**
0
1
2
3
4
=> 5
>> **exit**
$
----

By the way, an iterator does not necessarily have to pass a variable to
the block:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **5.times { puts 'example' }**
example
example
example
example
example
=> 5
>> exit
$
----

[[blocks]]
Blocks
++++++

A block is the code that is triggered by an iterator. In the block, you
have access to the local variable(s) passed by the iterator.

[[method-upto]]
Method upto
+++++++++++

Apart from `times` there is also the method `upto`, for easily
implementing a loop. `ri` offers a nice example for this, too:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ri -T Fixnum.upto**
Fixnum.upto

(from ruby site)
Implementation from Integer
-------------------------------------------------
  int.upto(limit) {|i| block }  ->  self
  int.upto(limit)               ->  an_enumerator


-------------------------------------------------

Iterates block, passing in integer values from int up to and
including limit.

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.

  5.upto(10) { |i| print i, " " }

produces:

  5 6 7 8 9 10
----

[[arrays-and-hashes]]
Arrays and Hashes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As in many programming languages, _arrays_ and _hashes_ are popular
structures in Ruby for storing data.

[[arrays]]
Arrays
^^^^^^

An array is a list of objects. Let's play around in `irb:`

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = [1,2,3,4,5]**
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>> **a.class**
=> Array
>> **exit**
$
----

That is simple and easy to understand.

Let's see if it also works with strings in the array:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = ['Test', 'Banana', 'blue']**
=> ["Test", "Banana", "blue"]
>> **a.class**
=> Array
>> **a[1]**
=> "Banana"
>> **a[1].class**
=> String
>> **exit**
$
----

That also works.

So all that's missing now is an array with a mixture of both. Obviously
that will work, too, because the array stores objects and it does not
matter which kind of objects they are (i.e. `String`, `Fixnum`, `Float`,
...). But a little test can't hurt:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = [1, 2.2, 'House', nil]**
=> [1, 2.2, "House", nil]
>> **a.class**
=> Array
>> **a[0]**
=> 1
>> **a[0].class**
=> Fixnum
>> **a[2]**
=> "House"
>> **a[2].class**
=> String
>> **exit**
$
----

Next, let's have a look at what the `ri` help page says for `Array`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ri -T Array**
Array < Object

Includes:
Enumerable (from ruby site)

(from ruby site)
Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Array indexing
starts at 0, as in C or Java.  A negative index is assumed to be relative to
the end of the array---that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of
the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on.

Class methods:

  []
  new
  try_convert

Instance methods:

  &
  *
  +
  -
  <<

[...]
----

As you can see, arrays can also be created via the method `new` (like
any class). Individual new elements can then be added at the end of an
array via the method `<<`. Here is the corresponding example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = Array.new**
=> []
>> **a << 'first item'**
=> ["first item"]
>> **a << 'second item'**
=> ["first item", "second item"]
>> **exit**
$
----

[[iterator-each]]
Iterator `each`
+++++++++++++++

You can work your way through an array piece by piece via the method
`each`. Example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **cart = ['eggs', 'butter']**
=> ["eggs", "butter"]
>> **cart.each do |item|**
?>   **puts item**
>> **end**
eggs
butter
=> ["eggs", "butter"]
>> **exit**
$
----

Once more, `ri` provides help and an example in case you forget how to
use each:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ri -T Array.each**
Array.each

(from ruby site)

  ary.each {|item| block }   -> ary
  ary.each                   -> an_enumerator

Calls block once for each element in self, passing that element
as a parameter.

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.

  a = [ "a", "b", "c" ]
  a.each {|x| print x, " -- " }

produces:

  a -- b -- c --
----

[[hashes]]
Hashes
^^^^^^

A _Hash_ is a list of _key/value pairs_. Here is an example with
strings as keys:

[subs="quotes"]

Of course, hashes can store not just strings as objects in the values,
but - as with arrays - also classes that you define yourself (see
link:#arrays[the section called "Arrays"]).

[[symbols]]
Symbols
+++++++

_Symbols_ are a strange concept and difficult to explain. But they are
very useful and used frequently, amongst others with hashes. Normally,
variables always create new objects:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **a = 'Example 1'**
=> "Example 1"
>> **a.object_id**
=> 70124141350360
>> **a = 'Example 2'**
=> "Example 2"
>> **a.object_id**
=> 70124141316700
>> **exit**
$
----

In both cases, we have the variable `a`, but object ID is different. We
could carry on in this way indefinitely. Each time, it would generate a
different object ID and therefore a new object. In principle, this is no
big deal and entirely logical in terms of object orientation. But it is
also rather a waste of memory space.

A symbol is defined by a colon before the name and cannot store any
values itself, but it always has the same object ID, so it is very well
suited to be a _key_:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **:a.class**
=> Symbol
>> **:a.object_id**
=> 702428
>> **exit**
$
----

Let's do another little experiment to make the difference clearer. We
use a string object with the content “`white`” three times in a row and
then the symbol `:white` three times in a row. For `"white"`, a new
object is created each time. For the symbol `:white`, only the first
time:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **'white'.object_id**
=> 70342874305700
>> **'white'.object_id**
=> 70342874300640
>> **'white'.object_id**
=> 70342874271720
>> **:white.object_id**
=> 1088668
>> **:white.object_id**
=> 1088668
>> **:white.object_id**
=> 1088668
>> **exit**
$
----

Using symbols as key for hashes is much more memory efficient:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **colors = { black: '#000000', white: '#FFFFFF' }**
=> {:black=>"#000000", :white=>"#FFFFFF"}
>> **puts colors[:white]**
#FFFFFF
=> nil
>> **exit**
$
----

You will frequently see symbols in Rails. If you want to find out more
about symbols, go to the help page about the class Symbol via
`ri Symbol`.

[[iterator-each-1]]
Iterator each
+++++++++++++

With the method `each` you can work your way through a `Hash` step by
step. Example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **colors = {black: '#000000', white: '#FFFFFF' }**
=> {:black=>"#000000", :white=>"#FFFFFF"}
>> **colors.each do |key, value|**
?>   **puts "#{key} #{value}"**
>> **end**
black #000000
white #FFFFFF
=> {:black=>"#000000", :white=>"#FFFFFF"}
>> **exit**
$
----

Again, `ri` offers help and an example, in case you cannot remember one
day how to use each:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ri -T Hash.each**
Hash.each

(from ruby site)

  hsh.each      {| key, value | block } -> hsh
  hsh.each_pair {| key, value | block } -> hsh
  hsh.each                              -> an_enumerator
  hsh.each_pair                         -> an_enumerator

Calls block once for each key in hash, passing the key-value pair
as parameters.

If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.

  h = { "a" => 100, "b" => 200 }
  h.each {|key, value| puts "#{key} is #{value}" }

produces:

  a is 100
  b is 200

[[range]]
Range
^^^^^

The class Range represents an interval. The start and end points of the
interval are defined enclosed in normal brackets and separated by two
dots in between them. Here is an example in which we use a range like an
iterator with each:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **(0..3)**
=> 0..3
>> **(0..3).class**
=> Range
>> **(0..3).each do |i|**
?>   **puts i**
>> **end**
0
1
2
3
=> 0..3
>>
----

Via the method `to_a` you can generate an array from a `Range`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **(0..3).to_a**
=> [0, 1, 2, 3]
>>
----

A range can be generated from objects of any type. Important is only
that the objects can be compared via `<=>` and use the method `succ` for
counting on to the next value. So you can also use `Range` to represent
letters:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **('a'..'h').to_a**
=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"]
>>
----

As alternative notation, you may sometimes come across `Range.new()`. In
this case, the start and end points are not separated by two dots, but
by a comma. This is what it looks like:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **(0..3) == Range.new(0,3)**
=> true
>> **exit**
$
----
