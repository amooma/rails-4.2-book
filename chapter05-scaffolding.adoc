Scaffolding and REST
--------------------

[[introduction]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scaffolding means purely and simply that a basic _scaffold_ for an
application is created via a generator. This scaffold not only contains
the _model_ but also a simple Web GUI (_views_) and of course a
_controller_. The programming paradigm used for this is REST
(Representational State Transfer).

You can find a definition of REST at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer]. My super
short version: the inventor Roy Fielding described in 2000 how you can
access data with a simple set of rules within the concept of CRUD (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) and the
specification of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). CRUD is the
abbreviation for Create (SQL: INSERT), Read (SQL: SELECT), Update (SQL:
UPDATE) and Delete (SQL: Delete). This created URLs that are easy to
read for humans and have a certain logic. In this chapter, you will see
examples showing the individual paths for the different CRUD functions.

I think the greatest frustration with Rail arises regularly from the
fact that many beginners use scaffolding to get quick results without
having proper basic knowledge of Ruby and without knowing what
ActiveRecord is. They don’t know what to do next. Fortunately, you have
worked your way through the chapters xref:ruby-basics["Ruby
Basics"], xref:first-steps-with-rails["First
Steps with Rails"] and xref:activerecord["ActiveRecord"], so you will be able to understand and use scaffolding
straight away.

NOTE: This chapter is an introduction to scaffolding, not an encyclopedia that
      covers all variations. Our focus is on the basic idea and on getting
      beginners started. The same applies to REST.

[[generating-a-scaffold]]
Generating a Scaffold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s first use scaffolding to create a list of products for an online
shop. First, we need to create a new Rails application:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails new shop**
  [...]
$ **cd shop**
$
----

Let’s look at the scaffolding options:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails generate scaffold**
Usage:
  rails generate scaffold NAME [field[:type][:index] field[:type][:index]]
  [options]

[...]

Examples:
    `rails generate scaffold post`
    `rails generate scaffold post title body:text published:boolean`
    `rails generate scaffold purchase amount:decimal tracking_id:integer:uniq`
    `rails generate scaffold user email:uniq password:digest`
----

I’ll keep it short: for our current state of knowledge, we can use
`rails generate scaffold` just like `rails generate model`. Let’s now create the scaffold for the
products:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails generate scaffold product name 'price:decimal{7,2}'**
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20150418150127_create_products.rb
      create    app/models/product.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/product_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/products.yml
      invoke  resource_route
       route    resources :products
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/products_controller.rb
      invoke    erb
      create      app/views/products
      create      app/views/products/index.html.erb
      create      app/views/products/edit.html.erb
      create      app/views/products/show.html.erb
      create      app/views/products/new.html.erb
      create      app/views/products/_form.html.erb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/controllers/products_controller_test.rb
      invoke    helper
      create      app/helpers/products_helper.rb
      invoke      test_unit
      invoke    jbuilder
      create      app/views/products/index.json.jbuilder
      create      app/views/products/show.json.jbuilder
      invoke  assets
      invoke    coffee
      create      app/assets/javascripts/products.coffee
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/products.scss
      invoke  scss
      create    app/assets/stylesheets/scaffolds.scss
$
----

As you can see, `rails generate scaffold` has already created the model.
So we can directly call `rake db:migrate`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rake db:migrate**
== 20150418150127 CreateProducts: migrating ===================================
-- create_table(:products)
   -> 0.0023s
== 20150418150127 CreateProducts: migrated (0.0024s) ==========================
$
----

Let’s create the first six products in the `db/seeds.rb`. I am not quite
sure about Walter Scheel, but after all, this book is all about Rails,
not German post-war history.

[source,ruby]
----
Product.create(name: 'Apple', price: 1)
Product.create(name: 'Orange', price: 1)
Product.create(name: 'Pineapple', price: 2.4)
Product.create(name: 'Marble cake', price: 3)
----

Populate with the example data:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rake db:seed**
----

[[the-routes]]
The Routes
^^^^^^^^^^

`rails generate scaffold` has created a route (more on this later in the chapter
xref:routes["Routes"]), a controller and
several views for us.

We could also have done all of this manually. Scaffolding is merely an
automatism that does the work for us for some basic things. This is
assuming that you always want to view, create and delete records.

Without diving too deeply into the topic routes, let’s just have a quick
look at the available routes for our example. You need to run
`rake routes`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rake routes**
      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action
    products GET    /products(.:format)          products#index
             POST   /products(.:format)          products#create
 new_product GET    /products/new(.:format)      products#new
edit_product GET    /products/:id/edit(.:format) products#edit
     product GET    /products/:id(.:format)      products#show
             PATCH  /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
             PUT    /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
             DELETE /products/:id(.:format)      products#destroy
$
----

These are all the routes and consequently URLs available in this Rails
application. All routes invoke actions (in other words, methods) in the
`ProductsController`.

[[the-controller]]
The Controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now it’s about time we had a look at the file
`app/controllers/products_controller.rb`. Scaffold automatically creates
the methods index, show, new, create, update and destroy. These methods
or actions are called by the routes.

Here is the content of `app/controllers/products_controller.rb`

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/products_controller.rb
----
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_product, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]

  # GET /products
  # GET /products.json
  def index
    @products = Product.all
  end

  # GET /products/1
  # GET /products/1.json
  def show
  end

  # GET /products/new
  def new
    @product = Product.new
  end

  # GET /products/1/edit
  def edit
  end

  # POST /products
  # POST /products.json
  def create
    @product = Product.new(product_params)

    respond_to do |format|
      if @product.save
        format.html { redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product was successfully
        created.' }
        format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @product }
      else
        format.html { render :new }
        format.json { render json: @product.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
      end
    end
  end

  # PATCH/PUT /products/1
  # PATCH/PUT /products/1.json
  def update
    respond_to do |format|
      if @product.update(product_params)
        format.html { redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product was successfully
        updated.' }
        format.json { render :show, status: :ok, location: @product }
      else
        format.html { render :edit }
        format.json { render json: @product.errors, status:
        :unprocessable_entity }
      end
    end
  end

  # DELETE /products/1
  # DELETE /products/1.json
  def destroy
    @product.destroy
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html { redirect_to products_url, notice: 'Product was
      successfully destroyed.' }
      format.json { head :no_content }
    end
  end

  private
    # Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.
    def set_product
      @product = Product.find(params[:id])
    end

    # Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white
    # list through.
    def product_params
      params.require(:product).permit(:name, :price)
    end
end
----

Let us take a moment and go through this controller.

[[set_product]]
set_product
+++++++++++

A `before_action` calls a private method to set an instance variable
`@product` for the actions :show, :edit, :update and :destroy. That DRYs
it up nicely:

[source,ruby]
----
before_action :set_product, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]

[...]

private
  # Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.
  def set_product
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  end
[...]
----

[[index]]
index
+++++

The `index` method sets the instance variable `@products`. It contains
the result of `Product.all`.

[source,ruby]
----
# GET /products
# GET /products.json
def index
  @products = Product.all
end
----

[[show]]
show
++++

The `show` method doesn’t do anything. `set_product` `before_action`
already set the instance variable `@product`. So there is not more to
do.

[source,ruby]
----
# GET /products/1
# GET /products/1.json
def show
end
----

[[new]]
new
+++

The `new` method creates a new instance of Product and saves it in the
instance variable `@product`.

[source,ruby]
----
# GET /products/new
def new
  @product = Product.new
end
----

[[edit]]
edit
++++

The `edit` method doesn’t do anything. the `set_product` `before_action`
already set the instance variable `@product`. So there is not more to
do.

[source,ruby]
----
# GET /products/1/edit
def edit
end
----

[[create]]
create
++++++

The `create` method uses `Product.new` to create a new instance of
Product and stores it in `@product`. The private method `product_params`
is used to filter the trusted parameters with a white list. When
`@product` was successfully saved a `redirect` to the `show` action is
initiated for html requests. If a validation error occurred the `new`
action will be rendered.

[source,ruby]
----
# POST /products
# POST /products.json
def create
  @product = Product.new(product_params)

  respond_to do |format|
    if @product.save
      format.html { redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product was successfully
      created.' }
      format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @product }
    else
      format.html { render :new }
      format.json { render json: @product.errors, status:
      :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end

[...]

# Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list
# through.
def product_params
  params.require(:product).permit(:name, :price)
end
----

[[update]]
update
++++++

The `update` method tries to update @product with the `product_params`.
The private method `product_params` is used to filter the trusted
parameters with a white list. When `@product` was successfully updated a
`redirect` to the `show` action is initiated for html requests. If a
validation error occured the `edit` action will be rendered.

[source,ruby]
----
# PATCH/PUT /products/1
# PATCH/PUT /products/1.json
def update
  respond_to do |format|
    if @product.update(product_params)
      format.html { redirect_to @product, notice: 'Product was successfully
      updated.' }
      format.json { render :show, status: :ok, location: @product }
    else
      format.html { render :edit }
      format.json { render json: @product.errors, status:
      :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end

[...]

# Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list
# through.
def product_params
  params.require(:product).permit(:name, :price)
end
----

[[destroy]]
destroy
+++++++

The `destroy` method destroys `@product` and redirects an html request
to the `index` action.

[source,ruby]
----
# DELETE /products/1
# DELETE /products/1.json
def destroy
  @product.destroy
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html { redirect_to products_url, notice: 'Product was successfully
    destroyed.' }
    format.json { head :no_content }
  end
end
----

[[the-views]]
The Views
^^^^^^^^^

Now we start the Rails web server:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails server**
=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 4.2.1 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
[2015-04-18 17:20:44] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2015-04-18 17:20:44] INFO  ruby 2.2.1 (2015-02-26) [x86_64-darwin14]
[2015-04-18 17:20:44] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=21563 port=3000
----

Now a little drum roll ... dramatic suspense ... launch the web browser and go
to the URL http://localhost:3000/products. You can see the list of
products as simple web page.

image:screenshots/chapter05/products_index.jpg[products
index,title="Products index"]

If you now click the link _New Product_, you will see an input form
for a new record:

image:screenshots/chapter05/product_new.jpg[product
new,title="Products new"]

Use your browser’s Back button to go back and click on the _Show_ link
in the first line. You will then see the following page:

image:screenshots/chapter05/product_show_1.jpg[product
show,title="Products show"]

If you now click _Edit_, you will see the editing view for this
record:

image:screenshots/chapter05/product_edit_1.jpg[product
edit,title="Products edit"]

And if you click _Destroy_ on the Index page, you can delete a record
after confirming the message that pops up. Isn’t that cool?! Within less
than 10 minutes, you have written a Web application that allows you to
*c*reate, *r*ead/*r*etrieve, *u*pdate and *d*elete/*d*estroy records
CRUD. That is the scaffolding magic. You can save a lot of time.

[[where-are-the-views]]
Where Are the Views?
++++++++++++++++++++

You can probably guess, but let’s have a look at the directory
`app/views/products` anyway:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **find app/views/products/**
app/views/products/
app/views/products/_form.html.erb
app/views/products/edit.html.erb
app/views/products/index.html.erb
app/views/products/index.json.jbuilder
app/views/products/new.html.erb
app/views/products/show.html.erb
app/views/products/show.json.jbuilder
$
----

There are two different file extensions. The `html.erb` is for HTML
requests and the `json.jbuilder` is for JSON requests.

For `index`, `edit`, `new` and `show` the corresponding views are
located there. As `new` and `edit` both require a form for editing the
data, this is stored in the partial `_form.html.erb` in accordance with the principle of DRY (*D*on’t *R*epeat
*Y*ourself) and integrated in `new.html.erb` and `edit.html.erb` with a
`<%= render 'form' %>`.

Let’s open the file `app/views/products/index.html.erb`:

[source,erb]
.app/views/products/index.html.erb
----
<p id="notice"><%= notice %></p>

<h1>Listing Products</h1>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @products.each do |product| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= product.name %></td>
        <td><%= product.price %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Show', product %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_product_path(product) %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', product, method: :delete, data: { confirm:
        'Are you sure?' } %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

<%= link_to 'New Product', new_product_path %>
----

You are now an old hand when it comes to ERB, so you’ll be able to read
and understand the code without any problems.

[[link_to]]
link_to
+++++++

In the views generated by the scaffold generator, you first came across
the helper `link_to`. This creates `<a hre ...>` links. You can of
course also enter a link manually via `<a href="...">` in the erb, but
for linrks within a Rails project, `link_to` is more practical, because
you can use the names of the routes as a target. The code becomes much
easier to read. In the above example, there are the following routes:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rake routes**
      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action
    products GET    /products(.:format)          products#index
             POST   /products(.:format)          products#create
 new_product GET    /products/new(.:format)      products#new
edit_product GET    /products/:id/edit(.:format) products#edit
     product GET    /products/:id(.:format)      products#show
             PATCH  /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
             PUT    /products/:id(.:format)      products#update
             DELETE /products/:id(.:format)      products#destroy
$
----

The first part of this route is the name of the route. With a new call,
this is `new_product`. A link to `new_product` looks like this in the
erb code (you can see it at the end of the file
`app/views/products/index.html.erb`):

[source,erb]
----
<%= link_to 'New Product', new_product_path %>
----

In the HTML code of the generated page (http://localhost:3000/products)
you can see the result:

[source,erb]
----
<%= link_to 'New Product', new_product_path %>
----

With `link_to` you can also link to resources within a RESTful resource.
Again, you can find examples for this in
`app/views/products/index.html.erb`. In the table, a `show`, an `edit`
and a `destroy` link is rendered for each `product`:

[source,erb]
----
<tbody>
  <% @products.each do |product| %>
    <tr>
      <td><%= product.name %></td>
      <td><%= product.price %></td>
      <td><%= link_to 'Show', product %></td>
      <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_product_path(product) %></td>
      <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', product, method: :delete, data: { confirm:
      'Are you sure?' } %></td>
    </tr>
  <% end %>
</tbody>
----

From the resource and the selected route, Rails automatically determines
the required URL and the required HTTP verb (in other words, whether it
is a POST, GET, PUT or DELETE). For index and show calls, you need to
observe the difference between singular and plural.
`link_to 'Show', product` links to a single record and
`link_to 'Show', products_path` links to the index view.

Whether the name of the route is used with or without the suffix `_path`
in `link_to` depends on whether Rails can ``derive'' the route from the
other specified information. If only one object is specified (in our
example, the variable `product`), then Rails automatically assumes that
it is a show route.

Examples:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|ERD-Code |Explanation
|`link_to 'Show', Product.first` |Link to the first product.

|`link_to 'New Product', new_product_path` |Link to the Web interface
where a new product can be created.

|`link_to 'Edit', edit_product_path(Product.first)` |Link to the form
where the first product can be edited.

|`link_to 'Destroy', Product.first, method: :delete` |Link to deleting
the first product.
|=======================================================================

[[form_for]]
form_for
++++++++

In the partial used by `new` and `edit`,
`app/views/products/_form.html.erb`, you will find the following code
for the product form:

[source,erb]
.app/views/products/_form.html.erb
----
<%= form_for(@product) do |f| %>
  <% if @product.errors.any? %>
    <div id="error_explanation">
      <h2><%= pluralize(@product.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this
      product from being saved:</h2>

      <ul>
      <% @product.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
        <li><%= message %></li>
      <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <% end %>

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :name %><br>
    <%= f.text_field :name %>
  </div>
  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :price %><br>
    <%= f.text_field :price %>
  </div>
  <div class="actions">
    <%= f.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
----

In a block, the helper `form_for` takes care of creating the HTML form
via which the user can enter the data for the record or edit it. If you
delete a complete `<div class="field">` element here, this can no longer
be used for input in the web interface. I am not going to comment on all
possible form field variations at this point. The most frequently used
ones will appear in examples later on and be explained then (if they are
not self-explanatory).

NOTE: You can find an overview of all form helpers at
      http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html

When using validations in the model, any validation errors that occur
are displayed in the following code at the head of the form:

[source,erb]
----
<% if @product.errors.any? %>
    <div id="error_explanation">
      <h2><%= pluralize(@product.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this
      product from being saved:</h2>

      <ul>
      <% @product.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
        <li><%= message %></li>
      <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <% end %>
----

Let’s add a small validation to the `app/models/product.rb` model:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/product.rb
----
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name,
            presence: true
end
----

When ever somebody wants to save a product which doesn’t have a name
Rails will show this Flash Error:

image:screenshots/chapter05/product_error_flash.jpg[product error
flash,title="Products error flash"]

[[access-via-json]]
Access via JSON
+++++++++++++++

By default, Rails’ scaffolding generates not just access via HTML for
human users, but also a direct interface for machines. The same methods
`index`, `show`, `new`, `create`, `update` and `destroy` can be called
via this interface, but in a format that is easier to read for machines.
As an example, we will demonstrate the `index` action via which all data
can be read in one go. With the same idea, data can be removed
(`destroy`) or edited (`update`).

JSON (see
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation[wikipedia.org/wiki/Json])
seems to be the new cool kid. So we use JSON.

If you do not require machine-readable access to data, you can remove
these lines in the file `Gemfile` (followed by the command `bundle`).

[source,ruby]
.Gemfile
----
# Build JSON APIs with ease. Read more: https://github.com/rails/jbuilder
gem 'jbuilder', '~> 2.0'
----

Of course you can delete the `format.json` lines manually too. But
please don’t forget to delete the JSON view files too.

[[json-as-default]]
JSON as Default

Right at the beginning of `app/controllers/products_controller.rb` you
will find the entry for the index action:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/products_controller.rb
----
# GET /products
# GET /products.json
def index
  @products = Product.all
end
----

The code is straightforward. In the instance variable `@products`, all
products are saved. The view `app/views/products/index.json.jbuilder`
contains the following code to render the JSON:

[source,ruby]
.app/views/products/index.json.jbuilder
----
json.array!(@products) do |product|
  json.extract! product, :id, :name, :price
  json.url product_url(product, format: :json)

You can use your browser to fetch the JSON output. Just open
http://localhost:3000/products.json and view the result. I installed a
JSON view extension in my Chrome browser to get a nicer format.

index json,title="Products index json"]

If you do not want the JSON output, you need to delete the
`json.jbuilder` files.

[[json-and-xml-together]]
JSON and XML Together

If you ever need a JSON and XML interface in a Rails application, you
just need to specify both variants in the controller in the block
`respond_to`. Here is an example with the
`app/controllers/products_controller.rb` in the `index` action:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/products_controller.rb
----
# GET /products
# GET /products.json
# GET /products.xml
def index
  @products = product.all

  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # index.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @products }
    format.xml { render xml: @products }
  end
end

[[when-should-you-use-scaffolding]]
When Should You Use Scaffolding?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should never use scaffolding just for the sake of it. There are
Rails developers who never use scaffolding and always build everything
manually. I find scaffolding quite useful for quickly getting into a new
project. But it is always just the beginning.

[[example-for-a-minimal-project]]
Example for a Minimal Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let’s assume we need a web page quickly with which we can list products
and represent them individually. But we do not require an editing or
deleting function. In that case, a large part of the code created via
scaffold would be useless and have to be deleted. Let’s try it out as
follows:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails new read-only-shop**
  [...]
$ **cd read-only-shop**
$ **rails generate scaffold product name 'price:decimal{7,2}'**
  [...]
$ **rake db:migrate**
  [...]
$
----

Now create the `db/seeds.rb` with some demo products:

[source,ruby]
.db/seeds.rb
----
Product.create(name: 'Apple', price: 1)
Product.create(name: 'Orange', price: 1)
Product.create(name: 'Pineapple', price: 2.4)
Product.create(name: 'Marble cake', price: 3)
----

And populate it with this data:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rake db:seed**
$
----

As we only need `index` and `show`, we should delete the not required
views:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rm app/views/products/_form.html.erb**
$ **rm app/views/products/new.html.erb**
$ **rm app/views/products/edit.html.erb**
$
----

The `json.jbuilder` views are not needed either:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rm app/views/products/*.json.jbuilder**
$
----

The file `app/controllers/products_controller.rb` can be simplified with
an editor. It should look like this:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/products_controller.rb
----
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  # GET /products
  def index
    @products = Product.all
  end

  # GET /products/1
  def show
    @product = Product.find(params[:id])
  end
end
----

We only need the routes for `index` and `show`. Please open the file
`config/routes.rb` and edit it as follows:

[source,ruby]
.config/routes.rb
----
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :products, only: [:index, :show]
end
----

A `rake routes` shows us that really only `index` and `show` are routed
now:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rake routes**
  Prefix Verb URI Pattern             Controller#Action
products GET  /products(.:format)     products#index
 product GET  /products/:id(.:format) products#show
----

If we now start the server `rails server` and go to the URL
http://localhost:3000/products, we get an error message.

image:screenshots/chapter05/products_routes_error.jpg[products
index json,title="Products index json"]

The same message will be displayed in the log:

[subs="quotes"]

[...]
----

The error message states that we call an undefined method
`edit_product_path` in the view `app/views/products/index.html.erb`. As
we only route `index` and `show` now, there are no more `edit`,
`destroy` or `new` methods any more. So we need to adapt the file
`app/views/products/index.html.erb` in the editor as follows:

[source,erb]
.app/views/products/index.html.erb
----
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @products.each do |product| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= product.name %></td>
        <td><%= product.price %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Show', product %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>
----

And while we are at it, we also edit the
`app/views/products/show.html.erb` accordingly:

[source,erb]
.app/views/products/show.html.erb
----
<p>
  <strong>Name:</strong>
  <%= @product.name %>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Price:</strong>
  <%= @product.price %>
</p>

<%= link_to 'Back', products_path %>
----

Now our application is finished. Start the Rails server with
`rails server` and open the URL http://localhost:3000/products in the
browser.

NOTE: In this example, I am not commenting on the required changes in the
      tests, as this is not an exercise for test driven development but meant
      to demonstrate a way of working with scaffolding. TDD developers will
      quickly be able to adapt the tests.

[[conclusion]]
Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

Have a go and try it out. Try working with scaffolds one time and
without them the next. Then you will soon get a feel for whether it fits
into your working method or not. I find that scaffolding makes my work
much easier for standard applications.
