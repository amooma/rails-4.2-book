Preface
-------

Thank you for buying the second edition of my 3rd Ruby on Rails book.
I wrote this book for autodidacts who learn best by following clean examples.
I don’t like the idea of coding one big single application throughout a book
but prefer stand-alone examples. So you can skip a couple of pages or even
chapters without losing context.

Don’t let people fool you into believing that Ruby on Rails is easy to
learn. It is not! It is probably the best and most effective framework
to develop web applications but it is hard to understand in the
beginning. The worst mistake of all is to not learn Ruby before diving
into Ruby on Rails. To avoid it this book starts with the basics of Ruby.
You will not become a Ruby guru after reading it but you’ll
understand the basic ideas and that is important.

I’m always thankful for feedback by e-mail
(stefan.wintermeyer@amooma.de) or Twitter
(https://twitter.com/wintermeyer). And any good rating on Amazon helps
paving the road to a Rails 5.0 version of this book.

Have fun with Ruby on Rails!
