[[first-steps-with-rails]]
First Steps with Rails
----------------------

Now that you have painstakingly read your way through
link:chapter02-ruby-basics.html[Chapter 2 - Ruby Basics] we can move on
to a more exciting bit. In this chapter, we will start our first Ruby on
Rails project and find our way into the topic step by step.

NOTE: In this chapter, we will also move on the double in some cases.
      Once more, there will be some typical chicken and egg problems.

[[environment-development]]
Environment (Development)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default a Rails project offers three different environments:

* Development
* Test
* Production

In this chapter, we are only working with the Development environment.
Once you have gained a better feeling for Rails, we will start using
tests and then we will need the corresponding environment (where, for
example, the Test database is populated when you start a test and then
cleared). Later, I will explain the various scenarios to show how you
can roll out your Rails application from the Development environment to
the Production environment.

The Development environment has everything you need for developing,
apart from an editor and a web browser. So you do not need to install a
special web server, but can use the integrated Rails web server. It does
not exactly have extremely high performance, but you do not need that
for developing. Later, you can switch to big web servers like Apache or
Nginx. The same applies to the database.

In order to work in the Development environment, you do not need to make
any changes to start with - all commands work by default.

[[sqlite-3-database]]
SQLite-3 Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In terms of the database, the main focus in this chapter is once more
not on optimum performance, but on showing you a simple way of getting
started. That's why we are using the SQLite-3 database. You already have
everything you need fully installed and you don't need to worry about
anything. Later I will explain how you can use other databases (for
example MySQL).

[[why-is-it-all-in-english]]
Why Is It All in English?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not a native English speaker, you should try to accept and
even adopt Rails' love for the English language. Much of it will then be
much easier and more logical. Most of the code then reads just like a
normal English sentence. For example, many mechanisms automagically use
plural or singular forms of normal English words. If you get used to
naming database fields and tables with English terms (even if you are
programming in a different language), then you can make use of the whole
power of this magic. This mechanism is referred to as `Inflector` or
_Inflections_.

If you are programming in a language other than English, it still makes
sense to use English names for variables, classes and methods. You can
write the comments in your own language, but if you take part in
international projects, you should obviously write the comments in
English as well. Yeah, sure … well written code does not need any
comments. ;-)

[[static-content-html-and-graphics-files]]
Static Content (HTML and Graphics Files)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are reading this text, you will already know that you can use
Rails to somehow output web pages. The question is just how it's done.
Let's first create a new Rails project.

[[create-rails-project]]
Create Rails Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before we even get going, please check that you are using Ruby version
2.2.1:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ruby -v**
ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-darwin14]
$
----

Next, check if Rails 4.2 is also installed:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails -v**
Rails 4.2.4
$
----

That's looking good. If you have an older version of Ruby or Rails
installed, please install the 4.2 version before you read any further.

Now we start by creating a new Rails project with the name
`testproject`. Ruby on Rails is a framework, so we first need to set up
the corresponding directory structure and basic configuration, including
several scripts. Easy as pie, just use the command
`rails new testproject` to create everything you need:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails new testproject**
    create
    create  README.rdoc
    create  Rakefile
    create  config.ru
    create  .gitignore
    [...]
$
----

Next, we check if the new Rails application is working by launching the
integrated web server.

TIP: Depending on the operating system (for example, Mac OS X) and on
     your firewall settings, you may see a popup window when first
     starting a Rails application, asking you if the firewall should
     permit the corresponding connection.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **cd testproject**
$ **rails server**
=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 4.2.4 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
[2015-04-14 18:52:26] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1

[2015-04-14 18:52:26] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=81168 port=3000
----

The start of the Rails application is looking good. It tells us:

[subs="quotes"]
----
Rails 4.2.4 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
----

So let's go to the URL http://localhost:3000 in the web browser. Welcome
aboard You're riding Ruby on Rails! …

image::screenshots/chapter03/virgin_rails_app.jpg[Virgin rails app]

Looks good. Rails seems to be working fine. The log of it tells what
just happend:

[subs="quotes"]
----
Started GET "/" for ::1 at 2015-04-14 19:11:32 +0200
Processing by Rails::WelcomeController#index as HTML

Completed 200 OK in 31ms (Views: 9.0ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
----

If we now click the link “_About your application's environment_”, we
can more information on the current environment.

IMPORTANT: With a classic `Ctrl+C` you can stop the web server.


[[static-pages]]
Static Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are certain static pages, images and JavaScript files that are
automatically output by Rails. Remember part of the output of the
command `rails new testproject`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails new testproject**
    [...]
    create  public/404.html
    create  public/422.html
    create  public/500.html
    create  public/favicon.ico
    create  public/robots.txt
    [...]
----

The directory name `public` and the files it contains already look very
much like static pages. Let's have a go and create the file
`public/hello-world.html` with the following content:

[source,erb]
.public/hello-world.html
----
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hello World!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>An example page.</p>
</body>
</html>
----

Now start the Rails web server with `rails server`

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails server**
=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 4.2.4 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
[2015-04-14 19:15:02] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2015-04-14 19:15:02] INFO  ruby 2.2.1 (2015-02-26) [x86_64-darwin14]
[2015-04-14 19:15:02] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=10559 port=3000
----

We can have a look at this web page at the URL
http://localhost:3000/hello-world:

image::screenshots/chapter03/hello-world-html.jpg[Hello Word]

No output in the log means: This page was not handled by the Rails
framework. It was delivered directly from the webserver.

NOTE: We can of course also use the URL
      http://localhost:3000/hello-world.html. But Rails regards
      HTML and therefore the file ending `.html` as standard output
      format, so you can omit the `.html` here.

Now you know how you can integrate fully static pages in Rails. This is
useful for pages that never change and that you want to work even if
Rails is not currently working, for example because of an update. In a
production environment, you would usually put a classic web server such
as Apache or Nginx infront of the Rails server. Which is capable of
autonomously delivering static files from the `public` directory. You'll
learn how to set up a production webserver in
link:chapter15-production-webserver.html[Chapter 15, Web Server in
Production Mode].

With `Ctrl+C` you can stop the Rails server.

[[creating-html-dynamically-with-erb]]
Creating HTML Dynamically with erb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The content of an `erb` file will propably seem familiar to you. It
is a mixture of HTML and Ruby code (`erb` stands for *e*mbedded *R*uby).
erb pages are rendered as Views. This is the first time for us to get in
touch with the MVC model. We need a controller to use a view. That can
be created it via the generator `rails generate controller`. Let's have
a look at the onboard help of this generator:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails generate controller**
Usage:
  rails generate controller NAME [action action] [options]

Options:
      [--skip-namespace], [--no-skip-namespace]  # Skip namespace (affects only isolated applications)
      [--skip-routes], [--no-skip-routes]        # Don't add routes to config/routes.rb.
  -e, [--template-engine=NAME]                   # Template engine to be invoked
                                                 # Default: erb
  -t, [--test-framework=NAME]                    # Test framework to be invoked
                                                 # Default: test_unit
      [--helper]                                 # Indicates when to generate helper
                                                 # Default: true
      [--assets]                                 # Indicates when to generate assets
                                                 # Default: true

Runtime options:
  -f, [--force]                    # Overwrite files that already exist
  -p, [--pretend], [--no-pretend]  # Run but do not make any changes
  -q, [--quiet], [--no-quiet]      # Suppress status output
  -s, [--skip], [--no-skip]        # Skip files that already exist

Description:
    Stubs out a new controller and its views. Pass the controller name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of views as arguments.

    To create a controller within a module, specify the controller name as a
    path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers and invokes helper,
    template engine, assets, and test framework generators.

Example:
    `rails generate controller CreditCards open debit credit close`

    CreditCards controller with URLs like /credit_cards/debit.
        Controller: app/controllers/credit_cards_controller.rb
        Test:       test/controllers/credit_cards_controller_test.rb
        Views:      app/views/credit_cards/debit.html.erb [...]
        Helper:     app/helpers/credit_cards_helper.rb
$
----

Nice! We are kindly provided with an example further down:

[subs="quotes"]
----
rails generate controller CreditCard open debit credit close
----

Doesn't really fit the bill for our case but I am feeling brave and
suggest that we simply try `rails generate controller Example test`

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails generate controller Example test**
      create  app/controllers/example_controller.rb
       route  get 'example/test'
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/example
      create    app/views/example/test.html.erb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/controllers/example_controller_test.rb
      invoke  helper
      create    app/helpers/example_helper.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      invoke  assets
      invoke    coffee
      create      app/assets/javascripts/example.coffee
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/example.scss
$
----

Phew... that's a lot of stuff being created. Amongst others, the file
`app/views/example/test.html.erb`. Let's have a closer look at it:

[source,erb]
.app/views/example/test.html.erb
----
<h1>Example#test</h1>
<p>Find me in app/views/example/test.html.erb</p>
----

It's HTML, but for it to be a valid HTML page, something is “missing” at
the top and bottom (the missing HTML "rest" will be explained in
link:#layouts[the section called "Layouts"]). We launch the web server
to test it:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails server**
----

and have a look at the web page in the browser at the URL
http://localhost:3000/example/test:

In the log `log/development.log` we find the following lines:

[subs="quotes"]
----
Started GET "/example/test" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-04-14 19:30:37 +0200

[...]
----

That almost reads like normal English. Let us analyse the first part:

[subs="quotes"]
----
Started GET "/example/test" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-04-14 19:30:37 +0200
Processing by ExampleController#test as HTML
  Rendered example/test.html.erb within layouts/application (2.3ms)
----

`localhost` (127.0.0.1) sent in an HTTP GET request for the URI
“`/example/test`”. That was then apparently rendered as HTML by the
controller `ExampleController` using the method test.

NOTE: The other lines tell us that a bunch of CSS and JavaScript
      files are compiled and than delivered. In production mode
      these would be precompiled and delivered by the asset pipeline
      as one CSS and one JavaScript file.

Now we just need to find the controller. Good thing you bought this
book. ;-) All controllers are in the directory `app/controllers`, and
there you go, we indeed find the corresponding file
`app/controllers/example_controller.rb.`

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **ls -l app/controllers/**
total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 xyz  204 14 Apr 19:04 application_controller.rb
drwxr-xr-x  3 xyz  102 14 Apr 19:04 concerns
-rw-r--r--  1 xyz   69 14 Apr 19:26 example_controller.rb
$
----

Please open the file `app/controllers/example_controller.rb` with your
favorite editor:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/example_controller.rb
----
class ExampleController < ApplicationController
  def test
  end
end
----

That is very clear. The controller `ExampleController` is a descendant
of the `ApplicationController` and contains currently just one method
with the name test. This method contains currently no program logic.

You will probably ask yourself how Rails knows that for the URL path
/example/test it should process the controller `ExampleController` and
the method `test`. This is not determined by some magical logic, but by
a _routing_ configuration. The current routings can be listed with the
command `rake routes`

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rake routes**
      Prefix Verb URI Pattern             Controller#Action
example_test GET  /example/test(.:format) example#test
$
----

These routes are configured in the file `config/routes.rb` which has
been auto-filled by the controller generator with a route to
`example/test`. The one line which is important for us right now is the
second one:

[source,ruby]
.config/routes.rb
----
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'example/test'

  [...]
----

The `config/routes.rb` file includes a lot of examples. Give it a read
when you have time. We'll dive into that later
link:chapter06-routing.html[Chapter 6, Routes].

IMPORTANT: A static file in the directory `public` always has higher
           priority than a route in the `config/routes.rb`! So if we
           were to save a static file `public/example/test` that file
           will be delivered.

[[programming-in-an-erb-file]]
Programming in an erb File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Erb` pages can contain Ruby code. You can use it to program and give
these page dynamic content.

Let's start with something very simple: adding 1 and 1. First we try out
the code in `irb`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> 1 + 1
=> 2
>> **exit**
$
----

That was easy.

IMPORTANT: If you want to output the result of Ruby code, enclose the
           code within a `<%=` ... `%>`.

We fill the `erb` file `app/views/example/test.html.erb` as follows:

[source,ruby]
.app/views/example/test.html.erb
----
<h1>First experiment with erb</h1>
<p>Addition:
  <%= 1 + 1 %>
</p>
----

Then use `rails server` to launch the web server.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails server**
----

Visit that page with the URL http://localhost:3000/example/test

image::screenshots/chapter03/erb_einfache_addition.jpg[ERB einfache addition]

You may ask yourself: how can the result of adding two `Fixnums` be
displayed as a String? Let's first look up in `irb` if it really is a
`Fixnum`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **irb**
>> **1.class**
=> Fixnum
>> **(1 + 1).class**
=> Fixnum
----

Yes, both the number 1 and the result of 1 + 1 is a `Fixnum`. What
happened? Rails is so intelligent that it automatically calls all
objects in a view (that is the file `test.html.erb`) that are not
already a string via the method `.to_s`, which always converts the
content of the object to a string
(link:chapter02-ruby-basics.html#method-to-s-for-your-own-classes[the
section called “Method to_s for Your Own Classes”]). Once more, a brief
trip to `irb`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
>> **(1 + 1).to_s**
=> "2"
>> **(1 + 1).to_s.class**
=> String
>> **exit**
----

You are now going to learn the finer points of `erb` step by step. Don't
worry, it's neither magic nor rocket science.

[[vs.-...]]
<% ... %> vs. <%= ... %>
++++++++++++++++++++++++

In a `.html.erb`file, there are two kinds of Ruby code instructions in
addition to the HTML elements:

* <% … %>
+
Executes the Ruby code it contains, but does not output anything (unless
you explicitly use something like `print` or `puts`).
* <%= … %>
+
Executes the Ruby code it contains and outputs the result as a String.
If is is not a String the method `to_s` will be called.

IMPORTANT: The output of `<%= ... %>`` is automatically escaped.
           So you don't need to worry about "dangerous" HTML.

Let's use an example, to make sure it all makes sense. We use `each` to
iterate through the Range `(0..5)`. Edit the
`app/views/example/test.html.erb` as follows:

[source,erb]
.app/views/example/test.html.erb
----
<p>Loop from 0 to 5:
<% (0..5).each do |i| %>
<%= "#{i}, " %>
<% end %>
</p>
----

Open this view in the browser:

image::screenshots/chapter03/erb_einfache_schleife.jpg[ERB loop]

Let's now have a look at the HTML source code in the browser:

[source,erb]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Testproject2</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="/assets/example.self-e3b0...b855.css?body=1"  data-turbolinks-track="true" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="/assets/application.self-e80e...9113.css?body=1" data-turbolinks-track="true" />
  <script src="/assets/jquery.self-d03a...c074.js?body=1" data-turbolinks-track="true"></script>
  <script src="/assets/jquery_ujs.self-8e98...3ee7.js?body=1" data-turbolinks-track="true"></script>
  <script src="/assets/turbolinks.self-c377...bfff.js?body=1" data-turbolinks-track="true"></script>
  <script src="/assets/example.self-877a...5c05.js?body=1" data-turbolinks-track="true"></script>
  <script src="/assets/application.self-3b8d...a819.js?body=1" data-turbolinks-track="true"></script>
  <meta name="csrf-param" content="authenticity_token" />
  <meta name="csrf-token" content="L4db...fd4U+TIg==" />
</head>
<body>

<p>Loop from 0 to 5:
0,
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
</p>

</body>
</html>
----

Now you have the important tools to use Ruby code in a view.

[[q-a]]
Q & A
+++++

[qanda]
I don't understand anything. I can't cope with the Ruby code. Could you please explain it again?::
  Is it possible that you have not completely worked your way through
  link:chapter02-ruby-basics.md[Chapter 2, _Ruby Basics_]? Please do take
  your time with it and have another thorough look. Otherwise, the rest
  won't make any sense here.
I can understand the Ruby code and the HTML output. But I don't get why some HTML code was rendered around it if I didn't even write that HTML code. Where does it come from, and can I influence it?::
  Excellent question! We will get to that in the next section.

[[layouts]]
Layouts
^^^^^^^

The `erb` file in the directory `app/views/example/` only forms the core
of the later HTML page. By default, an automatically generated
`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` is always rendered around it.
Let's have a closer look at it:

[source,erb]
.app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Testproject2</title>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
</head>
<body>

<%= yield %>

</body>
</html>
----

The interesting bit is the line

[source,erb]
<%= yield %>

With `<%= yield %>` the view file is included here. The lines with the
stylesheets, the JavaScript and the `csrf_meta_tags` can stay as they are
for now. We'll have a look into that in
link:chapter12-asset-pipeline.html[chapter12 Asset pipeline]. No need to
bother with that right now.

The file `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` enables you to
determine the basic layout for the entire Rails application. If you want
to enter a `<hr>` for each page and above it a text, then you can do
this between the `<%= yield %>` and the `<body>` tag:

[source,erb]
.app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Testproject</title>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", :media => "all" %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag "application" %>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My Header</h1>
<hr>

<%= yield %>

</body>
</html>
----

You can also create other layouts in the directory `app/views/layouts/`
and apply these layouts depending on the relevant situation. But let's
leave it for now. The important thing is that you understand the basic
concept.

[[passing-instance-variables-from-a-controller-to-a-view]]
Passing Instance Variables from a Controller to a View
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the cardinal sins in the MVC model is to put too much program
logic into the view. That's more or less what used to be done frequently
in PHP programming in the past. I'm guilty of having done it myself. But
one of the aims of MVC is that any HTML designer can create a view
without having to worry about the programming. Yeah, yeah, … if only it
was always that easy. But let's just play it through in our minds: if I
have a value in the controller that I want to display in the view, then
I need a mechanism for this. This is referred to as _instance variable_
and always starts with a `@`. If you are not 100 % sure any more which
variable has which _scope_, then please have another quick look at
link:chapter02-ruby-basics.html#scope-of-variables[the section called
“Scope of Variables”].

In the following example, we insert an instance variable for the current
time in the controller and then insert it in the view. So we are taking
programming intelligence from the view to the controller.

The controller file `app/controllers/example_controller.rb` looks like
this:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/example_controller.rb
----
class ExampleController < ApplicationController
  def test
    @current_time = Time.now
  end
end
----

In the view file `app/views/example/test.html.erb` we can then access
this instance variable:

[source,erb]
.app/views/example/test.html.erb
----
<p>
The current time is
<%= @current_time %>
</p>
----

With the controller and the view, we now have a clear separation of
programming logic and presentation logic. So now we can automatically
adjust the time in the controller in accordance with the user's time
zone, without the designer of the page having to worry about it. As
always, the method `to_s` is automatically applied in the view.

I am well aware that no-one will now jump up from their chair and shout:
“Thank you for enlightening me! From now on, I will only program neatly
in accordance with MVC.” The above example is just the first small step
in the right direction and shows how we can easily get values from the
controller to the view with instance variables.

[[partials]]
Partials
^^^^^^^^

Even with small web projects, there are often elements that appear
repeatedly, for example a _footer_ on the page with contact info or a
menu. Rails gives us the option of encapsulate this HTML code in form of
_partials_ and then integrating it within a view. A partial is also
stored in the directory `app/views/example/`. But the file name must
start with an underscore (`_`).

As an example, we now add a mini footer to our page in a separate
partial. Copy the following content into the new file
`app/views/example/_footer.html.erb`:

[source,erb]
.app/views/example/_footer.html.erb
----
<hr>
<p>
  Copyright 2009 - <%= Date.today.year %> the Easter Bunny.
</p>
----

NOTE: Yes, this is not the MVC way of doing it. `Date.today.year`
      should be defined in the Controller. I'm glad that you
      caught this mistake. I made this example to show the use
      of a partial.

We edit the file `app/views/example/test.html.erb` as follows and insert
the partial via the command render:

[source,erb]
.app/views/example/test.html.erb
----
<p>Loop from 0 to 5:
<% (0..5).each do |i| %>
<%= "#{i}, " %>
<% end %>
</p>

<%= render "footer" %>
----

So now we have the following files in the directory `app/views/example`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ ls app/views/example/
_footer.html.erb  test.html.erb
$
----

The new web page now looks like this:

image::screenshots/chapter03/partials_footer.jpg[Partials footer]

IMPORTANT: The name of a partial in the code is always specified
           _without_ the preceding underscore (`_`) and
           _without_ the file extension `.erb` and `.html`. But
           the actual file must have the underscore at the
           beginning of the file name and end with the file
           extension `.erb` and `.html`.

Partials can also be integrated from other areas of the subdirectory
`app/views`. For example, you can create a directory `app/views/shared`
for recurring and shared content and create a file `_footer.html.erb` in
this directory. You would then integrate this file into the `erb` code
via the line

[source,erb]
<%= render "shared/footer" %>

[[passing-variables-to-a-partial]]
Passing Variables to a Partial
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Partials are great in the sense of the DRY (*D*on't *R*epeat *Y*ourself)
concept. But what makes them really useful is the option of passing
variables. Let's stick with the copyright example. If we want to pass
the start year as value, we can integrate this by adding the following
in the file `app/views/example/_footer.html.erb`:

[source,erb]
.app/views/example/_footer.html.erb
----
<hr>
<p>
Copyright <%= start_year %> - <%= Date.today.year %> the Easter Bunny.
</p>
----

So let's change the file `app/views/example/test.html.erb` as follows:

[source,erb]
.app/views/example/test.html.erb
----
<p>Loop from 0 to 5:
<% (0..5).each do |i| %>
<%= "#{i}, " %>
<% end %>
</p>

<%= render partial: "footer", locals: {start_year: '2000'} %>
----

If we now go to the URL http://localhost:3000/example/test, we see the
2000:

image::screenshots/chapter03/partial_start_year_2000.jpg[Partial start year 2000]

Sometimes you need a partial that partially uses a local variable and
somewhere else you may need the same partial, but without the local
variable. We can take care of this in the partial itself with an if
statement:

[source,erb]
----
<hr>
<p>
  Copyright
  <%= "#{start_year} - " if defined? start_year %>
  <%= Date.today.year %>
  the Easter Bunny.
</p>
----

NOTE: `defined?` can be used to check if an expression has been defined.

Now you can call this partial with
`<%= render partial: "footer", locals: {start_year: '2000'} %>` and with
`<%= render 'footer' %>`.

[[further-documentation-on-partials]]
Further Documentation on Partials
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We have really only barely scratched the surface here. Partials are very
powerful tools. You can find the official Ruby on Rails documentation on
partials at:
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials.

[[redirects]]
Redirects
~~~~~~~~~

The name says it all, really: _redirects_ are commands that you can use
within the controller to “skip”, i.e. redirect, to other web pages.

NOTE: A redirect returns to the browser the response `302 Moved`
      with the new target. So each redirect does a roundtrip to
      the browser and back.

Let's create a new Rails project for a suitable example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails new redirect_example**
[...]
$ **cd redirect_example**
$
----

Before we can redirect, we need a controller with at least two different
methods. Off we go with a ping pong example:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails generate controller Game ping pong**
      create  app/controllers/game_controller.rb
       route  get 'game/pong'
       route  get 'game/ping'
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/game
      create    app/views/game/ping.html.erb
      create    app/views/game/pong.html.erb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/controllers/game_controller_test.rb
      invoke  helper
      create    app/helpers/game_helper.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      invoke  assets
      invoke    coffee
      create      app/assets/javascripts/game.coffee
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/game.scss
$
----

The controller `app/controllers/game_controller.rb` has the following
content:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/game_controller.rb
----
class GameController < ApplicationController
  def ping
  end

  def pong
  end
end
----

Now for the redirect: how can we achieve that we get immediately
redirected to the method pong when we go to
http://localhost:3000/game/ping? Easy, you will say, we just change the
route in `config/routes.rb`. And you are right. So we don't necessarily
need a redirect. But if we want to process something else in the method
ping before redirecting, then this is only possible by using a
`redirect_to` in the controller `app/controllers/game_controller.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/game_controller.rb
----
class GameController < ApplicationController
  def ping
   logger.info '+++  Example  +++'
   redirect_to game_pong_path
  end

  def pong
  end
end
----

But what is `game_pong_path`? Let's have a look a the routes generated
for this Rails application:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rake routes**
   Prefix Verb URI Pattern          Controller#Action
game_ping GET  /game/ping(.:format) game#ping
game_pong GET  /game/pong(.:format) game#pong
$
----

[NOTE]
====
As you can see, the route to the _action_ `ping` of the
controller `GameController` now gets the name `game_ping`
(see beginning of the line). We could also write the
redirect like this:

[source,ruby]
----
redirect_to :action => 'pong'
----
====

I will explain the details and the individual options of the redirect
later in the context of each specific case. For now, you just need to
know that you can redirect not just to another method, but also to
another controller or an entirely different web page.

When we try to go to http://localhost:3000/game/ping we are
automatically redirected to http://localhost:3000/game/pong and in the
log output we see this:

[subs="quotes"]
----
Started GET "/game/ping" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-04-15 17:50:04 +0200

  Rendered game/pong.html.erb within layouts/application (2.1ms)
Completed 200 OK in 2128ms (Views: 2127.4ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
----

[[redirect_to-back]]
redirect_to :back
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to redirect the user of your web application to the page he
has just been you can use `redirect_to :back`. This is very useful in a
scenario where your user first has to login to get access to a specific
page.

[[flash-messages]]
Flash Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In my eyes, the term “_flash messages_” is somewhat misleading. Almost
anyone would associate the term “_Flash_” with more or less colorful web
pages that were implemented with the Adobe Shockwave Flash Plug-in. But
in Ruby on Rails, flash messages are something completely different.
They are messages that are displayed, for example on the new page after
a redirect (see link:#redirects[Section 3.4, “Redirects”]).

Flash messages are good friends with redirects. The two often work
together in a team to give the user feedback on an action he just
carried out. A typical example of a flash message is the system feedback
when a user has logged in. Often the user is redirected back to the
original page and gets the message “You are now logged in.”

As an example, we are once more constructing the ping pong scenario from
link:#redirects[Section 3.4, “Redirects”]:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails new pingpong**
      [...]
$ **cd pingpong**
$ **rails generate controller Game ping pong**
      [...]
$
----

We fill the `app/controllers/game_controller.rb` with the following
content:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/game_controller.rb
----
class GameController < ApplicationController
  def ping
   redirect_to game_pong_path, notice: 'Ping-Pong!'
  end

  def pong
  end
end
----

Now we start the Rails web server with `rails server` and use the
browser to go to http://localhost:3000/game/ping. We are redirected from
ping to pong. But the flash message "Ping-Pong!" is nowhere to be seen.
We first need to expand `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

[source,erb]
.app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Pingpong</title>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
</head>
<body>
  <% flash.each do |name, message| %>
    <p>
      <i><%= "#{name}: #{message}" %></i>
    </p>
  <% end %>

  <%= yield %>
</body>
</html>
----

Now we see the flash message at the top of the page when we go to
http://localhost:3000/game/ping in the browser:

image::screenshots/chapter03/flash_pong_notice.jpg[flash pong notice]

If we go to http://localhost:3000/game/pong we still see the normal Pong
page. But if we go to http://localhost:3000/game/ping we are redirected
to the Pong page and then the flash message is displayed at the top.

TIP: If you do not see a flash message that you were expecting,
     first check in the view to see if the flash message is output
     there.

[[different-types-of-flash-message]]
Different Types of Flash Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flash messages are automagically passed to the view in a hash. By
default, there are three different types: `error`, `warning` and
`notice`. You can also invent your own category and then get it in the
view later.

You can set a flash message by writing the hash directly too:

[source,ruby]
flash[:notice] = 'Ping-Pong!'

Please have a look at the official documentation at
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#the-flash
for more information.

[[why-are-there-flash-messages-at-all]]
Why Are There Flash Messages At All?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may wonder why there are flash messages in the first place. Couldn't
you just build them yourself if you need them? Yes, indeed. But flash
messages have the advantage that they offer a defined approach that is
the same for any programmer. So you don't need to start from scratch
every single time you need one.

[[the-rails-console]]
The Rails Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _console_ in Rails is nothing more than an `irb` (see
link:chapter02-ruby-basics.html#irb[Section 2.3, “irb”]) built around
the Rails environment. The console is very useful both for developing
and for administration purposes, because the whole Rails environment is
represented and available.

For our working environment, we again use a variation of the ping pong
scenario from link:#redirects[Section 3.4, “Redirects”]:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails new pingpong**
      [...]
$ **cd pingpong**
$ **rails generate controller Game ping pong**
      [...]
$
----

Start the Rails console with the command `rails console`:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails console**
Loading development environment (Rails 4.2.4)
irb(main):001:0>
----

And you can use `exit` to get back out:

[subs="quotes"]
----
irb(main):001:0> exit
$
----

Many readers use this ebook on small mobile devises. For them I try to
keep any code or terminal output width to a minimum. To save the real
estate which is by default occupied by `irb(main):001:0>` we can start
`rails console` with the parameter `-- --simple-prompt`.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails console -- --simple-prompt**
Loading development environment (Rails 4.2.4)
>> **exit**
$
----

Alternativly you can change the IRB configuration in the file `.irbrc`
which is located in your home directory. If you want to have the simple
prompt you have to add the following line in that file.

[source,ruby]
----
IRB.conf[:PROMPT_MODE] = :SIMPLE
----

In the console, you have access to all variables that are also available
later in the proper application:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails console**
Loading development environment (Rails 4.2.4)
>> **Rails.env**
=> "development"
>> **Rails.root**
=> #<Pathname:/Users/xyz/pingpong>
>> **exit**
$
----

Already in link:chapter04-activerecord.html[Chapter 4, ActiveRecord] we
are going to be working lots with the console and will soon begin to
appreciate the possibilities it offers.

TIP: One of my best buddies when developing Rails applications
     is the Tab key. Whenever you are looking for a method for a
     particular problem, recreate it in the Rails console and then
     press the Tab key twice to list all available methods. The
     names of the methods are usually self-exlanatory.

[[app]]
app
^^^

`app` is useful if you want to analyze things to do with routing:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails console**
Loading development environment (Rails 4.2.4)
>> **app.url_for(controller: 'game', action: 'ping')**
=> "http://www.example.com/game/ping"
>> **app.get '/game/ping'**

Started GET "/game/ping" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-04-15 18:47:26 +0200
Processing by GameController#ping as HTML
Redirected to http://www.example.com/game/pong
Completed 302 Found in 10ms (ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
=> 302
>> **app.get '/game/pong'**

Started GET "/game/pong" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-04-15 18:47:33 +0200

  Rendered game/pong.html.erb within layouts/application (3.2ms)
Completed 200 OK in 2119ms (Views: 2117.6ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
=> 200
>> **exit**
$
----

[[what-is-a-generator]]
What is a Generator?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have already used the command `rails generate controller`. It starts
the generator with the name `controller`. There are other generators as
well. You can use the command `rails generate` to display a list of
available generators:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails generate**
Usage: rails generate GENERATOR [args] [options]

General options:
  -h, [--help]     # Print generator's options and usage
  -p, [--pretend]  # Run but do not make any changes
  -f, [--force]    # Overwrite files that already exist
  -s, [--skip]     # Skip files that already exist
  -q, [--quiet]    # Suppress status output

Please choose a generator below.

Rails:
  assets
  controller
  generator
  helper
  integration_test
  jbuilder
  job
  mailer
  migration
  model
  resource
  scaffold
  scaffold_controller
  task

Coffee:
  coffee:assets

Js:
  js:assets

TestUnit:
  test_unit:generator
  test_unit:job
  test_unit:plugin
$
----

What does a generator do? A generator makes a programmer's job easier by
doing some of the mindless tasks for you. It creates files and fills
them with content, depending on the parameters passed. You could do the
same manually, without the generator. So you do not have to use a
generator. It is primarily intended to save you work and avoid potential
errors that can easily arise from mindless repetitive tasks.

TIP: Someday you might want to create your own generator. Have a
     look at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html to find
     a description of how to do that.

[[helper]]
Helper
~~~~~~

A helper method takes care of recurring tasks in a view. For example, if
you want to display stars (*) for rating a restaurant and not a number
from 1 to 5, you can define the following helper in the file
`app/helpers/application_helper.rb` :

[source,ruby]
.app/helpers/application_helper.rb
----
module ApplicationHelper

  def render_stars(value)
    output = ''
    if (1..5).include?(value)
      value.times { output += '*'}
    end
    output
  end

end
----

With this helper, we can then apply the following code in a view:

[source,erb]
----
<p>
  <b>Rating:</b> <%= render_stars(5) %>
</p>
----

You can also try out the helper in the console:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails console**
Loading development environment (Rails 4.2.4)
>> **helper.render_stars(5)**
=> "*****"
>> **helper.render_stars(3)**
=> "***"
>> **exit**
$
----

There are lots of predefined helpers in Rails and we will use some of
them in the next chapters. But you can also define your own custom
helpers. Any of the helpers from the file
`app/helpers/application_helper.rb` can be used in any view. Helpers
that you want to be only available in certain views must be defined for
each controller. When creating a controller, a file for helpers of that
controller is automatically created in `app/helpers`. This gives you the
option of defining helpers only for this controller or for the views of
this controller.

All helpers are in the directory `app/helpers/.`

[[debugging]]
Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

Rails provides a couple of debug tools to make the developer's live
easier.

[[debug]]
debug
^^^^^

In any view you can use the `debug` helper to render an object with the
YAML format within a `<pre>` tag. To display the value of `@foo` you can
use the following line in your view:

[source,erb]
----
<%= debug @foo %>
----

[[web-console]]
Web Console
^^^^^^^^^^^

The `web-console` gem provides a way to render a rails console views. So
when you browser to a specific URL at the end of that page you'll get a
console.

Let me show you this by example with this simple rails application:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails new testapp**
  [...]
$ **cd testapp**
$ **rails generate controller page index**
----

In the `app/controllers/page_controller.rb` we add the following code:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/page_controller.rb
----
code,ruby
class PageController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @foo = 'bar'
  end
end
----

And in the view `app/views/page/index.html.erb` we'll add the `console`
command:

[source,ruby]
.app/views/page/index.html.erb
----
<h1>Page#index</h1>
<p>Find me in app/views/page/index.html.erb</p>

<%= console %>
----

After starting the rails application with `rails server` and browsing to
the URL `http://localhost:3000/page/index` we get a web console at the
bottom of the page. In it we have access to the instance variable
`@foo`.

image::screenshots/chapter03/web-console.jpg[Web Console]

[[other-debugging-tools]]
Other Debugging Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a couple of other build in debugging tools which are out of
the scope of this introduction. Please have a look at
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html to get
an overview.

[[rails-lingo]]
Rails Lingo
~~~~~~~~~~~

Here you find a couple of words which you'll often find in the Ruby on
Rails universe.

[[dry---dont-repeat-yourself]]
DRY - Don't repeat yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many Rails programmers are big fans of DRY. DRY means purely and simply
that you should try to place repeated programming logic into separate
methods.

[[refactoring]]
Refactoring
^^^^^^^^^^^

You often hear the word refactoring in the context of DRY. This involves
functioning applications that are further improved. The application in
itself remains unchanged in its interface. But its core is optimized,
amongst others through DRY.

[[convention-over-configuration]]
Convention Over Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Convention over configuration (also known as coding by convention, see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) is an
important pillar of a Rails application. It states that the programmer
does not need to decide in favour of certain features when starting a
project and set these via configuration parameters. It specifies an
underlying basic consensus and this is set by default. But if you want
to work outside of this conventional basic consensus, then you will need
to change the corresponding parameters.

[[model-view-controller-architecture-mvc]]
Model View Controller Architecture (MVC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have now already created a simple Rails application and in the next
chapter you will dive deeply into the topic ActiveRecord. So now is a
good time to very briefly introduce a few terms that often surface in
the world of Rails.

According to Wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller, MVC is a design
pattern that separates the representation of information from the user's
interaction with it.

MVC is a structure for software development. It was agreed that it makes
sense to have one part of the software in one place and another part of
the software in another place. Nothing more, nothing less.

*This agreement has the enormous advantage that once you are used to
this concept, you know exactly where you can find or need to integrate a
certain functionaity in a Rails project.*

[[model]]
Model
^^^^^

"Model" in this case means data model. By default, Rails applications
are an ActiveRecord data model (see
link:chapter04-activerecord.html[Chapter 4, AktiveRecord]).

All models can be found in the directory `app/models/.`

[[view]]
View
^^^^

The "view" is responsible for the presentation of the application. It
takes care of rendering the web page, an XML or JSON file. A view could
also render a PDF or an ASCII text. It depends entirely on your
application.

You will find all the views in the directory `app/views/.`

[[controller]]
Controller
^^^^^^^^^^

Once a web page call has ended up in a route (see
link:chapter06-routing.html[Chapter 6, Routes]), it goes from there to
the controller. The route specifies a certain method (action) as target.
This method can then fulfil the desired tasks (such as finding a
specific set of data and saving it in an instance variable) and then
renders the desired view.

All controllers can be found in the directory `app/controllers/.`
