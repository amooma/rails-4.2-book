Cookies and Sessions
--------------------

[[cookies]]
Cookies
~~~~~~~

With a cookie, you can store information on the web browser’s system, in
form of strings as key-value pairs that the web server has previously
sent to this browser. The information is later sent back from the
browser to the server in the HTTP header. A cookie (if configured
accordingly) is deleted from the browser system neither by restarting
the browser nor by restarting the whole system. Of course, the browser’s
user can manually delete the cookie.

NOTE: A browser does not have to accept cookies and it does not have to save
      them either. But we live in a world where almost every page uses
      cookies. So most users will have enabled the cookie functionality. For
      more information on cookies, please visit Wikipedia at
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http_cookie.

A cookie can only have a limited size (the maximum is 4 kB). You should
remember that the information of the saved cookies is sent from the
browser to the server. So you should only use cookies for storing small
amounts of data (for example, a customer number) to avoid the protocol
overhead becoming too big.

Rails provides a hash with the name `cookies[]` that we can use
transparently. Rails automatically takes care of the technological
details in the background.

To demonstrate how cookies work, we are going to build a Rails
application that places a cookie on a page, reads it out on another page
and displays the content, and the cookie is deleted on a third page.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails new cookie_jar**
  [...]
$ **cd cookie_jar**
$ **rails generate controller home set_cookies show_cookies delete_cookies**
  [...]
$
----

We populate the controller file `app/controllers/home_controller.rb` as
follows:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/home_controller.rb
----
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def set_cookies
    cookies[:user_name]   = "Smith"
    cookies[:customer_number] = "1234567890"
  end

  def show_cookies
    @user_name    = cookies[:user_name]
    @customer_number = cookies[:customer_number]
  end

  def delete_cookies
    cookies.delete :user_name
    cookies.delete :customer_number
  end
end
----

And the view file `app/views/home/show_cookies.html.erb` as follows:

[source,erb]
.app/views/home/show_cookies.html.erb
----
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>User Name:</td>
    <td><%= @user_name %></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Customer Number:</td>
    <td><%= @customer_number %></td>
  </tr>
</table>
----

Start the Rails server with `rails server` and go to the URL
http://localhost:3000/home/show_cookies in your browser. You will not
see any values.

image:screenshots/chapter08/show_cookies_empty.jpg[Show Cookies
empty,title="Show Cookies empty"]

Now go to the URL http://localhost:3000/home/set_cookies and then back
to http://localhost:3000/home/show_cookies. Now you will see the values
that we have set in the method `set_cookies`.

image:screenshots/chapter08/show_cookies_set.jpg[Show Cookies
set,title="Show Cookies set"]

By requesting the page http://localhost:3000/home/delete_cookies you can
delete the cookies again.

The cookies you have placed in this way stay alive in the browser
until you close the browser completely.

WARNING: The content of a normally cookie in the browser is easy to read and to
         be manipulated by the user. It is not encrypted, so it should not
         contain any passwords or similar data. Nor is it advisable to save
         shopping baskets in an unsigned (see link:#signed-cookies[the section
         called "Signed Cookies"]) cookie, otherwise the user could change the
         prices in this shopping basket himself.

[[permanent-cookies]]
Permanent Cookies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cookies are normally set to give the application a way of recognizing
users when they visit again later. Between these visits to the website,
much time can go by and the user may well close the browser in the
meantime. To store cookies for longer than the current browser session,
you can use the method permanent. Our above example can be expanded by
adding this method in the `app/controllers/home_controller.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/home_controller.rb
----
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def set_cookies
    cookies.permanent[:user_name]   = "Smith"
    cookies.permanent[:customer_number] = "1234567890"
  end

  def show_cookies
    @user_name    = cookies[:user_name]
    @customer_number = cookies[:customer_number]
  end

  def delete_cookies
    cookies.delete :user_name
    cookies.delete :customer_number
  end
end
----

IMPORTANT: "permanent" here does not really mean permanent. You cannot set a
           cookie permanently. When you set a cookie, it always needs a "valid
           until" stamp that the browser can use to automatically delete old
           cookies. With the method permanent this value is set to today’s date in
           20 years. This is practically the same as permanent.

[[signed-cookies]]
Signed Cookies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With normally placed cookies, you have no option on the application side
to find out if the user of the application has changed the cookie. This
can quickly lead to security problems, as changing the content of a
cookie in the browser is no great mystery. The solution is signing the
cookies with a key that is only known to us. This key is automatically
created via a random generator with each `rails new` and is located in
the file `config/initializers/secret_token.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.config/initializers/secret_token.rb
----
CookieJar::Application.config.secret_key_base = '85ec675d7702707667a25a'
----

WARNING: If you want to set up your Rails application from scratch again one day
         and start over with a fresh Rails project, it can be helpful to transfer
         this key into the new Rails application. Otherwise you can no longer use
         the previously placed cookies!

To sign cookies, you can use the method `signed`. You have to use it for
writing and reading the cookie. Our above example can be expanded by
adding this method in the `app/controllers/home_controller.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/home_controller.rb
----
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def set_cookies
    cookies.permanent.signed[:user_name]       = "Smith"
    cookies.permanent.signed[:customer_number] = "1234567890"
  end

  def show_cookies
    @user_name       = cookies.signed[:user_name]
    @customer_number = cookies.signed[:customer_number]
  end

  def delete_cookies
    cookies.delete :user_name
    cookies.delete :customer_number
  end
end
----

The content of the cookie is now saved in encrypted form every time you
set the cookie. The name of the cookie can still be read by the user,
but not the value.

[[sessions]]
Sessions
~~~~~~~~

As HTTP is a stateless protocol, we encounter special problems when
developing applications. An individual web page has no connection to the
next web page and they do not know of one another. But as you want to
register only once on many websites, not over and over again on each
individual page, this can pose a problem. The solution is called session
and Rails offers it to the programmer transparently as a `session[]`
hash. Rails automatically creates a new session for each new visitor of
the web page. This session is saved by default as cookie (see
link:chapter08-cookies-and-sessions.html[Section "Cookies"] and so it
is subject to the 4 kB limit. But you can also store the sessions in the
database (see link:#saving-sessions-in-the-database[the section called
"Saving Sessions in the Database"]). An independent and unique session
ID is created automatically and the cookie is deleted by default when
the web browser is closed.

The beauty of a Rails session is that we can not just save strings there
as with cookies, but also hashes and arrays. So you can for example use
it to conveniently implement a shopping cart in an online shop.

[[breadcrumbs-via-session]]
Breadcrumbs via Session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an example, we create an application with a controller and three
views. When a view is visited, the previously visited views are
displayed in a little list.

The basic application:

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails new breadcrumbs**
  [...]
$ **cd breadcrumbs**
$ **rails generate controller Home ping pong index**
  [...]
$
----

First we create a method with which we can save the last three URLs in
the session and set an instance variable `@breadcrumbs,` to be able to
neatly retrieve the values in the view. To that end, we set up a
`before_filter` in the `app/controllers/home_controller.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/home_controller.rb
----
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :set_breadcrumbs

  def ping
  end

  def pong
  end

  def index
  end

  private
  def set_breadcrumbs
    if session[:breadcrumbs]
      @breadcrumbs = session[:breadcrumbs]
    else
      @breadcrumbs = Array.new
    end

    @breadcrumbs.push(request.url)

    if @breadcrumbs.count > 4
      # shift removes the first element
      @breadcrumbs.shift
    end

    session[:breadcrumbs] = @breadcrumbs
  end
end
----

Now we use the `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` to display these
last entries at the top of each page:

[source,erb]
.app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Breadcrumbs</title>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all',
  'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
</head>
<body>

<% if @breadcrumbs && @breadcrumbs.count > 1 %>
  <h3>Surf History</h3>
  <ul>
    <% @breadcrumbs[0..2].each do |breadcrumb| %>
      <li><%= link_to breadcrumb, breadcrumb %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
<% end %>

<%= yield %>

</body>
</html>

<html>
----

Now you can start the Rails server with `rails server` and go to
http://localhost:3000/home/ping, http://localhost:3000/home/pong or
http://localhost:3000/home/index and at the top you will then always see
the pages that you have visited before. Of course, this only works on
the second page, because you do not yet have a history on the first page
you visit.

image:screenshots/chapter08/breadcrumbs_session_beispiel.jpg[Breadcrumbs
session example,title="Breadcrumbs session example"]

[[reset_session]]
reset_session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally, there are situations where you want to reset a session (in
other words, delete the current session and start again with a new,
fresh session). For example, if you log out of a web application, the
session will be reset. This is easily done and we can quickly integrate
it into our breadcrumb application (see
link:#breadcrumbs-via-session[the section called "Breadcrumbs via
Session"]):

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **rails generate controller Home reset**
        skip  app/controllers/home_controller.rb
       route  get 'home/reset'
      invoke  erb
       exist    app/views/home
      create    app/views/home/reset.html.erb
      invoke  test_unit
        skip    test/controllers/home_controller_test.rb
      invoke  helper
   identical    app/helpers/home_helper.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      invoke  assets
      invoke    coffee
   identical      app/assets/javascripts/home.coffee
      invoke    scss
   identical      app/assets/stylesheets/home.scss
$
----

The correspondingly expanded controller
`app/controllers/home_controller.rb` then looks like this:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/home_controller.rb
----
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :set_breadcrumbs

  def ping
  end

  def pong
  end

  def index
  end

  def reset
    reset_session
    @breadcrumbs = nil
  end

  private
  def set_breadcrumbs
    if session[:breadcrumbs]
      @breadcrumbs = session[:breadcrumbs]
    else
      @breadcrumbs = Array.new
    end

    @breadcrumbs.push(request.url)

    if @breadcrumbs.count > 4
      # shift removes the first element
      @breadcrumbs.shift
    end

    session[:breadcrumbs] = @breadcrumbs
  end
end
----

So you can delete the current session by going to the URL
http://localhost:3000/home/reset.

IMPORTANT: It is not just important to invoke `reset_session`, but you need to also
           set the instance variable `@breadcrumbs` to `nil`. Otherwise, the old
           breadcrumbs would still appear in the view..

[[saving-sessions-in-the-database]]
Saving Sessions in the Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Saving the entire session data in a cookie on the user’s browser is not
always the best solution. Amongst others, the limit of 4 kB can pose a
problem. But it’s no big obstacle, we can relocate the storing of the
session from the cookie to the database with the Active Record Session
Store gem (https://github.com/rails/activerecord-session_store). Then
the session ID is of course still saved in a cookie, but the whole other
session data is stored in the database on the server.

To install the gem we have to add the following line at the end of the
file `Gemfile`

[source,ruby]
.Gemfile
----
gem 'activerecord-session_store', github: 'rails/activerecord-session_store'
----

After that we have to run `bundle install`

[subs="quotes"]
----
$ **bundle install**

Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/..........
Fetching version metadata from https://rubygems.org/..

Using debug_inspector 0.0.2
[...]
$
----

After that we have to run
`rails generate active_record:session_migration` and `rake db:migrate`
to create the needed table in the database.

[subs="quotes"]
----
$  **rails generate active_record:session_migration**
      create  db/migrate/20150428183919_add_sessions_table.rb
$ **rake db:migrate**
== 20150428183919 AddSessionsTable: migrating =================================
-- create_table(:sessions)
   -> 0.0019s
-- add_index(:sessions, :session_id, {:unique=>true})
   -> 0.0008s
-- add_index(:sessions, :updated_at)
   -> 0.0008s
== 20150428183919 AddSessionsTable: migrated (0.0037s) ========================
$
----

After that we’ll have to change the `session_store` in the file
`config/initializers/session_store.rb` to `:active_record_store`.

[source,ruby]
.config/initializers/session_store.rb
----
Breadcrumbs::Application.config.session_store :active_record_store
----

Job done. Now you need to start the server again with `rails server` and
Rails saves all sessions in the database.
